I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Computer and Information Sciences) from the National University of Singapore. After a short stint in the IT industry, I left to pursue a calling to teach and hence, began my teaching career in 1991 as a Computer Science teacher in a junior college. In 2004, midway through my second posting, I accepted an offer to switch to teaching A-level Mathematics. After joining my third school, I was blessed with being able to finally take time off to study when I was offered the MOE Postgraduate Scholarship to complete my Master of Education (Mathematics) at the Nanyang Technological University.

The milestones in my years of service came from embracing the changes along the way. In my second school, I was given the opportunity to serve as Project Work (PW) coordinator and Chief Internal Moderator for the PW Examination. Subsequently, I covered duties for PW Subject Head when the school started its PW department. Leading a team of PW tutors that came from various disciplines gave me a chance to hone my leadership and interpersonal skills. At the same time, I continued to work on improving my pedagogical knowledge in teaching Mathematics.

The change to teach Mathematics after more than a decade of teaching Computing was indeed a major milestone for me. Embracing that change has helped me to better understand the difficulties students faced in learning Mathematics. This has in turn fuelled my passion to grow as a teacher. In 2009, I joined my third school not long after it started its six-year Integrated Programme (IP), with the hope to better understand how students’ prior knowledge impacts their learning. During my stay with the IP school, I had the opportunity to teach Project Work, H1 and H2 Mathematics, as well as Combinatorics in H3 Mathematics.

After I was appointed Senior Teacher (Mathematics) in 2010, I continued to develop myself as a teacher leader through various avenues such as coordinating H1 and H2 Mathematics, mentoring, leading the department lesson study project and sharing teaching practice. I also had the opportunity to promote teacher collaboration across schools when I helped plan and oversee the zonal annual teachers’ sharing organised by the school’s Centre of Excellence for Teaching and Learning.

In my pockets of free time, I enjoy reading and reflecting on inspirational quotes. One that resonated with me was from the late Dr Minor Myers, Jr. During his term as President of the Illinois Wesleyan University. He said in a graduation address to students, "Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good." It is my hope that students at Eunoia Junior College will see doing good as a worthy motivation for doing well. A student aspiring to do good will no doubt strive to do well.
