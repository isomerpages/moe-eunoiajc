I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) from the School of Physical and Mathematical Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), specialising in Statistics. During my undergraduate course, I was involved in the faculty’s freshmen orientation camps. I enjoyed organising the programmes and interacting with the juniors, guiding them as they began their university experience.

Before joining the education landscape, I worked for two years in Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB) as a manager under the public housing scheme, supervising a team of officers to process members’ applications and refunds. It was an enriching opportunity to handle members’ requests and appeals as well as participating in a project to enhance the system to shift from hardcopy to online forms.

Subsequently, I decided to pursue my passion for teaching and committed to a year of contract teaching in a secondary school. This affirmed my decision to be a teacher: I am able to educate future generations of youth, teaching them not only Mathematics but more importantly, morals and values. Hence, I enrolled in the Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) at the National Institute of Education (NIE) and graduated in 2021.

I have a strong belief in the growth mindset. My teaching philosophy is that every child can learn. I believe that intelligence can be developed; the role of a teacher is to provide scaffolding for students to improve. I would love to see them face obstacles with a positive mind and work hard to overcome failures. Through this, I also hope that they will be able to find joy in learning.

Outside of teaching, I enjoy exploring nature and engaging in various outdoor activities like hiking, cycling and kayaking. It seems to be a brand new experience each time I visit a different nature reserve, park or route. I believe the same can be said about teaching the different classes of students. I am grateful to be part of the Eunoia family and I am excited about the journey ahead.
