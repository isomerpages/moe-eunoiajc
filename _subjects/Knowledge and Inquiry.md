Is common-sense knowledge as valuable as academic knowledge? Can men ever know what women know? Is morality just a matter of convention? Was Mathematics discovered or invented?

In Knowledge &amp; Inquiry (KI), you will investigate and evaluate the nature and construction of knowledge. Exploring areas such as the sciences, the social sciences, history, mathematics, ethics and the aesthetics, you will critically evaluate what is regarded as knowledge in these contexts. If you have been told off once too often for incessantly asking ‘why’, the KI classroom offers you inroads into the possible answers to questions you have always wondered about.

### Our Curriculum

KI isn’t everyone’s cup of tea — you will need an intense curiosity to learn more about what knowledge is and what constitutes knowledge. You will also need to be able to work independently to satisfy your curiosity. KI students at Eunoia JC are handpicked from a selection test administered at the start ofJC1. Lessons, in an all-tutorial form, offer endless opportunities for rich and in-depth discussion. With an independent study essay, you can be assured of a strong focus on independent research skills, to prepare you for active participation as a young member of the academic community.

### Our Enrichment

The interdisciplinary nature of KI ensures that no one has a monopoly on the requisite knowledge. In the spirit of collaboration, guest lecturers from other EJC departments will be roped in to share their disciplinary expertise. Beyond the college, you will be encouraged to take part in university-level enrichment programmes. We endeavour to strive, to seek and to find more, not less.
