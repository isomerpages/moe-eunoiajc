<h4>“The apple cannot be stuck back on the Tree of Knowledge; once we begin to see, we are… challenged to seek the strength to see more, not less.”</h4>
<p><strong>Arthur Miller</strong>
</p>
<p>Is common-sense knowledge as valuable as academic knowledge? Can men ever
know what women know? Is morality just a matter of convention? Was Mathematics
discovered or invented?</p>
<p>In Knowledge &amp; Inquiry (KI), you will investigate and evaluate the
nature and construction of knowledge. Exploring areas such as the sciences,
the social sciences, history, mathematics, ethics and the aesthetics, you
will critically evaluate what is regarded as knowledge in these contexts.
If you have been told off once too often for incessantly asking ‘why’,
the KI classroom offers you inroads into the possible answers to questions
you have always wondered about.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>KI isn’t everyone’s cup of tea — you will need an intense curiosity to
learn more about what knowledge is and what constitutes knowledge. You
will also need to be able to work independently to satisfy your curiosity.
KI students at Eunoia JC are handpicked from a selection test administered
at the start of JC1. Lessons, in an all-tutorial form, offer endless opportunities
for rich and in-depth discussion. With an independent study essay, you
can be assured of a strong focus on independent research skills, to prepare
you for active participation as a young member of the academic community.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>The interdisciplinary nature of KI ensures that no one has a monopoly
on the requisite knowledge. In the spirit of collaboration, guest lecturers
from other EJC departments will be roped in to share their disciplinary
expertise. Beyond the college, you will be encouraged to take part in university-level
enrichment programmes. We endeavour to strive, to seek and to find more,
not less.</p>
