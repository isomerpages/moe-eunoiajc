<h4>“To communicate the truths of history is an act of hope for the future.”</h4>
<p><strong>Daisaku Ikeda</strong>
</p>
<p>History may be written by the victors, but is constantly rewritten by
the historian. In EJC, the student of History possesses the ability to
negotiate opposing interpretations of global events and the skills to assess
the past. You will debate the effectiveness of policies and investigate
the forces behind them across nations, Southeast Asia and international
politics. With cross-cultural skills and critical thinking skills that
come with History, you can begin to write the future of society.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>History considers regional and international developments of the twentieth
century through an issue-based, analytic approach. Adopting a conceptual
lens, you will recognise patterns of change and continuity, appreciate
diverse views about past and present, and make informed judgements of historical
accounts. Consider the evolution of the global social, political and economic
order and Southeast Asia’s search for identity and stability across two
papers, as you engage in collaborative research, thought-provoking debates
and a rigorous writing process.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>To us, history is ever-present. We will re-imagine debates between Gorbachev
and Reagan, stage mock-protests in Burma, hold Model United Nations conferences
and engage in other activities that bring the subject to life and into
the spotlight. On an overseas immersion trip in Asia or Europe, you will
experience first-hand how the past has shaped the present in authentic
case studies. Bring your broad perspectives to ministry dialogues and public
seminars, peering deep into national and international concerns. To leap
forward, take a step back through History.</p>
