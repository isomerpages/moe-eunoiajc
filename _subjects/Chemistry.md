As an EJC Science student, you are endowed with both depth and breadth of learning. Experience the forefront of scientific research at NUS and NTU or be enlightened by renowned academics at guest lectures and workshops. Learning journeys to STEM-related industries will broaden your understanding of how science is applied in society. You could develop the next big idea right here, with our in-house research opportunities, online courses and customised training for Science Olympiads. For budding professors, engage in university-style literature reviews and presentations. At EJC, we bond rigour and discovery.

#### **Our Curriculum**

Scientific thinking is beautiful thinking. To us, science is more than a body of knowledge. We see science as a way of life — of knowing and doing. Biology, Chemistry and Physics students will learn to navigate uncertainty, practise scientific inquiry and solve real-world problems both critically and creatively. We look beyond ‘right’ answers and are not afraid of mistakes. We want you, the EJC Science student, to embrace increasingly open and complex levels of knowledge, and experience the epiphany of Science.

#### **Our Enrichment**

Famously described as ‘the science of substances’, Chemistry is the study of matter, its structure and properties, and its transformation at the atomic or molecular level. Based on these three core ideas, we explore intriguing phenomena in everyday life and beyond. What makes water so unique? Why does gold still glitter despite being buried for eons, yet iron rapidly loses its shine to form rust? You will ask deep questions about the nature of scientific knowledge, practise constant inquiry to make meaningful connections and delve into the ethical dilemmas of research. Our Chemistry lessons balance hands-on and intellectually stimulating experiences, where you will always be the reactive element.
