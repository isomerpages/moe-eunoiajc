<center><h4>“Those who know nothing of foreign languages know nothing of their own.”</h4><b>Goethe</b></center>


Why stop at two (languages)? Eunoians who have completed the GCE ‘O’ Level French, German, Japanese and Spanish language programmes at the [**MOE Language Centre**](https://www.moelc.moe.edu.sg/)&nbsp;(MOELC) will be able to continue their language learning, leading towards the GCE A-Level Examination at the end of JC2. Registration for the programme is administered by MOELC.

H2 French, H2 German, H2 Japanese or H2 Spanish can be offered as the contrasting subject for students in the Science stream, and as one of three Humanities and the Arts subjects in the Arts stream.
