Scientific thinking is beautiful thinking. To us, science is more than a body of knowledge. We see science as a way of life — of knowing and doing. Biology, Chemistry and Physics students will learn to navigate uncertainty, practise scientific inquiry and solve real-world problems both critically and creatively. We look beyond ‘right’ answers and are not afraid of mistakes. We want you, the EJC Science student, to embrace increasingly open and complex levels of knowledge, and experience the epiphany of Science.

#### **Our Curriculum**

Does light always travel in straight lines? Does time move slower at thirty thousand feet? Do rainbows really have seven colours? Physics presents to us the exciting and ongoing challenge of attempting to understand the interactions of the physical world and systems ranging from galaxies to sub-atomic particles. With an inquiring mind, you will uncover how Physics has advanced our world in real ways. Our lessons are powered by real-world contexts, moving between live demonstrations, hands-on scientific investigation and thought-provoking experiments. Looking beyond theory, you will be able to apply your knowledge to enable future technological advancements.

#### **Our Enrichment**

As an EJC Science student, you are endowed with both depth and breadth of learning. Experience the forefront of scientific research at NUS and NTU or be enlightened by renowned academics at guest lectures and workshops. Learning journeys to STEM-related industries will broaden your understanding of how science is applied in society. You could develop the next big idea right here, with our in-house research opportunities, online courses and customised training for Science Olympiads. For budding professors, engage in university-style literature reviews and presentations. At EJC, we bond rigour and discovery.
