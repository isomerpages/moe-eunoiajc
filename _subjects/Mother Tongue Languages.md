<h4>“One language sets you in a corridor for life. Two languages open every door along the way.”</h4>
<p><strong>Frank Smith</strong>
</p>
<p>Want to fully appreciate your cultural heritage? Find yourself admiring
your friends who are adept at two or more languages, switching between
English and their mother tongues at will? The EJC Mother Tongue Languages
(MTL) department will create an authentic and conducive environment for
you to learn and use your respective Mother Tongue Language, and inspire
you to love, learn and appreciate it even more.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>At EJC, we recognise that every MTL learner comes from a different starting
point. We will build upon your prior knowledge and language ability, and
further hone your oral and written interaction skills. Through approaches
that encourage critical thinking in your mother tongue language, we want
to show you how learning can occur in any language, across all language
barriers.</p>
<p>Students who have obtained a D7 or better in Higher MTL at GCE O Level
do not need to offer H1 MTL in JC. While Chinese, Malay and Tamil Language
lessons are offered and held within the JC itself, Non-Tamil Indian Languages
(Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Urdu, and Bengali) will be offered at the respective
language centres.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>The vast majority of language learning takes place outside the classroom,
in the real world. Eunoians will benefit from our partnerships with external
institutions and the wider community — you will work first-hand with renowned
local mother tongue language writers, and have the opportunity to hear
from experts in the various linguistic fields. You will be involved in
celebrating our biculturalism and bilingualism through the Eunoia MTL Fortnight,
together with our extended community.</p>
