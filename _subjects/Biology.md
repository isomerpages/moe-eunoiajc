<h4>“With his five senses, man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure Science."</h4>
<p><strong>Edwin Hubble</strong>
</p>
<p>Scientific thinking is beautiful thinking. To us, science is more than
a body of knowledge. We see science as a way of life — of knowing and doing.
Biology, Chemistry and Physics students will learn to navigate uncertainty,
practise scientific inquiry and solve real-world problems both critically
and creatively. We look beyond ‘right’ answers and are not afraid of mistakes.
We want you, the EJC Science student, to embrace increasingly open and
complex levels of knowledge, and experience the epiphany of Science.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Do our genes determine who we are? Does human biology influence the decisions
we make? The study of Biology seeks to answer these questions by exploring
biological processes, structure and function, and the evolution of living
organisms at microscopic and molecular levels. On the macro level, we examine
how organisms interact with one another, the environment and the ecosystem.
The foundational ideas of Biology are suffused in all our learning experiences:
investigative hands-on activities, debates on bioethics and Socratic seminars
that hone your scientific reasoning skills. You will see in multiple ways
how Biology permeates your daily life. At EJC, it’s not just genes that
have differential expressions.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>As an EJC Science student, you are endowed with both depth and breadth
of learning. Experience the forefront of scientific research at NUS and
NTU or be enlightened by renowned academics at guest lectures and workshops.
Learning journeys to STEM-related industries will broaden your understanding
of how science is applied in society. You could develop the next big idea
right here, with our in-house research opportunities, online courses and
customised training for Science Olympiads. For budding professors, engage
in university-style literature reviews and presentations. At EJC, we bond
rigour and discovery.</p>
