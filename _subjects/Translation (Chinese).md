<h4>“Translation is not a matter of words only: it is a matter of making intelligible a whole culture.”</h4>
<p><strong>Anthony Burgess</strong>
</p>
<p>Is translation a science or an art? Is there always a best way to translate?
What is a translator’s role as compared to that of an author? And what
role does translation play in political, cultural and social issues, especially
in a multilingual society like Singapore? We have a lot to learn in and
about translation. In this subject, you will develop skills in the precise
comprehension of source texts and accurate reproduction in the target languages.
This subject will also allow you to obtain a better understanding of translation
theories and strategies, as well as critical appreciation of translation
as both an art and science.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Translation (Chinese) is a Chinese medium subject designed to develop
students’ interest and proficiency in practical translation as well as
critical appreciation of translations. The H2 Translation (Chinese) is
made up of two components – linguistics and translation. The linguistic
component serves as a foundation, providing students with the required
tools for systematic analysis of both the English and Chinese languages.
The translation component builds upon this foundation and provides students
with the theories and strategies for translation tasks. Furthermore, the
translation component develops students’ ability to critically analyse
translated texts as well as to appreciate the cultural contexts in translating
texts from Chinese to English and vice-versa.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>Translation is very much about practice. Working with our external partners,
we will expose our students to experienced practitioners and their real-world
translation practices. Students will also have the opportunities to learn
translation in more specific areas such as subtitling and computer-assisted
translation (CAT). Translation is fun, when you get the right meaning of
it.</p>
