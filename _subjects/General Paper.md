<h4>“The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not<br>be victory, but progress.”</h4>
<p><strong>Joseph Joubert</strong>
</p>
<p>Every single moment, something is changing in our world. Our thoughts
about the world also change, based on what we learn, what we know and what
we believe in. In General Paper, you will understand better the society
in which you live, and the implications of local, regional and global developments
for your everyday life. You will also develop maturity of thought and the
skill of effective communication. A deep curiosity about issues and perspectives
will be matched by your ability to positively impact your community, your
country and the world we live in.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that Eunoians must be excited about the world and take a personal
interest in what is going on around them. Lesson content will be authentic,
with discussions centring around current and real-life developments. These
are the core beliefs that will shape our novel curriculum structure, carried
out through a mix of lectures and tutorials. Even as we gear you towards
excellence at the GCE ‘A’ Level and beyond, you will be known for your
confidence in expressing informed and articulate opinions, in both written
and verbal forms.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>At EJC, we believe in providing our students with opportunities to have
real-world experiences and to voice their views. Robust and civil exchange
of perspectives within the student community is encouraged, and your work
can be showcased in a variety forms. In addition, you will have many opportunities
to use your knowledge to benefit the community around you – for example,
you can be part of student-led lectures or create podcasts to initiate
discussions about issues of local, regional and global significance!</p>
