<h4>“The essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom.”</h4>
<p><strong>Georg Cantor</strong>

<p>What does the area under a curve have to do with the cardiac output of
the human heart? The EJC Mathematics programme will create meaningful learning
experiences for you to better appreciate the beauty of Mathematics. You
will also see first-hand how classroom learning is deeply connected with
authentic real-world situations, and how mathematical applications abound
everywhere.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Construct + Apply + Extend = Excellence. This could very well be the law
that governs the Mathematics programme at EJC. It begins with the process
of construction, in which your personal learning experience counts for
more. You will then apply this co-constructed knowledge to both regular
and non-routine problems, and further extend your learning through opportunities
to evaluate and reflect on your work. Perhaps there is a winning formula
after all! EJC students in the Arts stream may offer Mathematics as a contrasting
subject at H1 or H2 level. If you have an enduring passion for Mathematics
and wish to acquire a wider range of mathematical concepts and skills,
you can offer&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/subjects/fmaths/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">H2 Further Mathematics</a></strong> as
a student in the Science stream.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>The EJC Mathematics Talent Development Programme aims to groom a pool
of Mathematics talents, adept at using computer modelling software to solve
real-world problems. If mathematical theory fascinates you, take on opportunities
to embark on high-level research. You will also get to pit your skills
against your international peers through a variety of worldwide mathematical
competitions. We see Mathematics as more than just a tool and a body of
knowledge. To us, Mathematics is a language that can be acquired and appreciated,
with ideas that transcend disciplines. There’s certainly truth in how Mathematics
is said to be the language in which the universe was written.</p>
