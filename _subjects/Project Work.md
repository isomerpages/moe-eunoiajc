<h4>“Part of education is learning. And what drives learning is curiosity and collaboration.”</h4>
<p><strong>Ken Robinson</strong>
</p>
<p>See, think, act. Where most people see problems, Eunoians see opportunities
to create a better future. As part of the Project Work programme, you will
hone your abilities and dispositions to be critical and inventive thinkers,
confident communicators and effective collaborators. You will also be equipped
with the skills to thrive in today’s complex world. But what greater purpose
do these skills serve, if not as a call for action? Project Work at EJC
will kindle your desire to be a trailblazer who dares to make a difference.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>The EJC Project Work Model is specially customised for our students, inspired
by a rich diversity of pedagogical literature. Various elements are synthesised
into our unique model that will drive Eunoians’ Project Work journeys,
through waypoints such as Feel, Negotiate, Understand, Ideate, Evaluate,
Communicate, Reflect and Act. Be prepared for an exciting ride, as you
see your project come to life in front of your very eyes!</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>While the Project Work assessment cycle may seem like a life of tests
for some, Project Work at Eunoia prepares you for the test of life. Through
a series of innovative platforms such as Unconferences, mass project pitches
and even negotiation programmes guiding Eunoians on how to conduct ‘Courageous
Conversations’, there will be something for everybody to come out of Project
Work a better person, better placed to make your community, Singapore and
the world a better place for everyone.</p>
