<h4>“The power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.”</h4>
<p><strong>Marcus du Sautoy</strong>

<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>If you have an enduring passion for Mathematics, you can offer <strong>H2 Further Mathematics</strong>,
where you will acquire a wider range of mathematical concepts and skills
that will set a strong foundation for future pursuits in science, technology
and engineering. You can look forward to a greater variety and depth of
exploration in mathematical modelling, as part of the Further Mathematics
programme.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>The EJC Mathematics Talent Development Programme aims to groom a pool
of Mathematics talents, adept at using computer modelling software to solve
real-world problems. If mathematical theory fascinates you, take on opportunities
to embark on high-level research. You will also get to pit your skills
against your international peers through a variety of worldwide mathematical
competitions. We see Mathematics as more than just a tool and a body of
knowledge. To us, Mathematics is a language that can be acquired and appreciated,
with ideas that transcend disciplines. There’s certainly truth in how Mathematics
is said to be the language in which the universe was written.</p>
