<center><h4>“So many of the world’s current issues boil down to geography, and need the geographers of the future to help us understand them.”</h4><b>Michael Palin</b></center>

Tectonic shifts give rise to far more than natural disasters. EJC Geography students are able to see how geological processes have an impact on society, the global economy and the environment, and appreciate the sophisticated links between Man and nature. Whether it is the management of scarce resources or the promise of alternative energies, you will navigate complex problems and learn to calibrate solutions that can shape a more inclusive society and a more liveable, sustainable world.

#### **Our Curriculum**

Geography, as a bridge between the natural and social sciences, seeks to understand the world in its entirety. You will explore enduring concepts such as time, space, processes and systems, and dive into real issues such as migration, water resources, climate change and sustainable development. Our curriculum leads you to think geographically and make the connections between big ideas and detailed facts, through a wide range of learning experiences that include group-based research, real-world analysis and argumentation.

#### **Our Enrichment**

Seeing, hearing, questioning and expressing are essential to the study of Geography. Be engaged in field trips, where you will collect and evaluate data, observe the interaction between the physical and human worlds, and present your findings. Take part in seminars and urban development challenges, or take it to the next level by proposing solutions to government ministries. Geography uncovers new territories and carves new routes between old ones, so that your knowledge is as far-reaching as it can be.
