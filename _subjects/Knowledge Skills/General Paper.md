<center><h4><em>“The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not<br>be victory, but progress.”<br><b>Joseph Joubert</b></em></h4></center>
	
Every single moment, something is changing in our world. Our thoughts about the world also change, based on what we learn, what we know and what we believe in. In General Paper, you will understand better the world in which you live, and how global developments affect you in your everyday life. You will also develop maturity of thought and the skill of effective communication. A deep intrigue in global matters will be matched by your ability to impact your community, your country and the world we live in.

### Our Curriculum

We believe that Eunoians must be excited about the world, and take a personal interest in what is going on around them. Lesson content will be authentic, with discussions centring around current and real-life developments. These are the core beliefs that will shape our novel curriculum structure, carried out through a mix of lectures and tutorials. Even as we gear you towards excellence at the GCE ‘A’ Level and beyond, you will be known for your confidence in expressing informed and articulate opinions, in both written and verbal forms.

### Our Enrichment

Of what value are opinions if there is no one to hear them? At EJC, we believe in providing our students with opportunities to voice their views, and will facilitate the robust and civil exchange of opinions within the student community. Your work will be showcased in a variety of publications across different media. You will have many opportunities to use your knowledge to benefit the community around you – for example, you can organise programmes to excite younger children about current affairs!
