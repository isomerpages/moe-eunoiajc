Want to fully appreciate your cultural heritage? Find yourself admiring your friends who are adept at two or more languages, switching between English and their mother tongues at will? The EJC Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department will create an authentic and conducive environment for you to learn and use your respective Mother Tongue Language, and inspire you to love, learn and appreciate it even more.

### Our Curriculum

At EJC, we recognise that every MTL learner comes from a different starting point. We will build upon your prior knowledge and language ability, and further hone your oral and written interaction skills. Through approaches that encourage critical thinking in your mother tongue language, we want to show you how learning can occur in any language, across all language barriers.

Students who have obtained a D7 or better in Higher MTL at GCE O Level do not need to offer H1 MTL in JC. While Chinese, Malay and Tamil Language lessons are offered and held within the JC itself, Non-Tamil Indian Languages (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Urdu, and Bengali) will be offered at the respective language centres.

### Our Enrichment

The vast majority of language learning takes place outside the classroom, in the real world. Eunoians will benefit from our partnerships with external institutions and the wider community — you will work first-hand with renowned local mother tongue language writers, and have the opportunity to hear from experts in the various linguistic fields. You will be involved in celebrating our biculturalism and bilingualism through the Eunoia MTL Fortnight, together with our extended community.
