<h4>“Economics is everywhere, and understanding economics can help you make better decisions."</h4>
<p><strong>Tyler Cowen</strong>
</p>
<p>What constitutes economic growth? Why do poor countries remain poor? How
are trading decisions made? As an EJC Economics student, you will analyse
the world with a new pair of eyes. Delve into the intricacies of human
behaviour and understand why consumers choose one brand over another. With
an appreciation of economic concepts and phenomena, you can respond constructively
to real issues and start to make positive change happen in Singapore and
the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Economics is a social science that studies how economic agents, ranging
from individuals to governments, allocate limited resources to meet unlimited
wants. Taking a student-centred approach, we empower you with an Economics
curriculum foregrounded by Paul and Elder’s critical thinking framework,
visible thinking strategies and a culture of collaborative learning. We
will equip you with the tools of economic analysis to appreciate how consumers,
firms and governments influence one another. In this dynamic and constantly
evolving social science, you will examine real case studies from multiple
perspectives and propose solutions together with a vibrant community of
learners. These insights will give you greater confidence in managing the
complexities and ambiguities of a changing economy.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that students thrive when there is authenticity and relevance
in learning. That is why we provide you opportunities to apply economic
concepts to the real world and to foster deep, interdisciplinary thinking.
Learning journeys, dialogues with esteemed leaders and university lecturers,
and meaningful partnerships with government committees bring authenticity
to your understanding of Economics. Enlarge your view by visiting overseas
financial institutions or actively participating in university lectures.
With knowledge of the economy, you have the ability to advance the world.</p>
