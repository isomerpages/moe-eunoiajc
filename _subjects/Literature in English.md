<center><h4><em>“It’s in literature that true life can be found.<br>It’s under the mask of fiction that you can tell the truth.”<br><b>Gao Xingjian</b></em></h4></center>


Every day, words move us and inspire us to act. The EJC student of Literature will be able to harness the power of words and their effects, passionately expressing his or her own personal voice. You will learn to find meaning amidst ambiguity and see universal ideas in diverse landscapes, understanding how culture and power are one. To study Literature is to study life itself. To practise Literature is to influence the lives of others.

### Our Curriculum

We believe that the Literature classroom thrives on discussion, which is why team-teaching and student-led seminars are the order of the day. In the core paper, you will master the literary nuances of poetic, narrative and dramatic texts, and sharpen your close analysis skills. Apply these to the elective paper, where you will traverse social, historical and cultural contexts in three different texts. Learn to compare unseen poems and set texts, and craft an interpretation you can truly call your own.

The college is offering the following papers and texts for the academic course of 2022-2023 and 2023-2024:

**Paper One: Reading Literature**

*   Jane Austen:&nbsp;_Pride and Prejudice_&nbsp;(Penguin)
*   William Shakespeare:&nbsp;_Measure for Measure_&nbsp;(New Cambridge)

**Paper Three: The Mind and Self in Literature (Elective Paper)**

*   Edward Albee:&nbsp;_Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_&nbsp;(Vintage)
*   Harold Pinter:&nbsp;_The Caretaker_&nbsp;(Faber)
*   Sylvia Plath:&nbsp;_Ariel_&nbsp;(Faber)

### Our Enrichment

In EJC, words leap off the page onto the stage. With our Eunoia Writer-in-Residence programme, you can encounter and pursue creative writing and performance first-hand. Set the rhythm at our own poetry slam competitions, have your work featured in our in-house literary publication or literally bring your texts into the spotlight at our annual literary festival. When we say Literature is life, we really mean it.
