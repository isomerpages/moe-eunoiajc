I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics (Honours) from the National University of Singapore in 2005 under a MOE Teaching Award, and subsequently obtained the Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education in 2006.

Fascinated with my Honours research project on Quantum Cryptography, I continued my research on Quantum Entanglement and attained a Master of Science from the Nanyang Technological University in 2008. I graduated with a GPA of 5.0 and made two publications in Physical Review A and International Journal of Quantum Information.

I started my teaching career in a junior college in 2006. During my 11 years there, I taught H2 Physics at the JC1 and JC2 levels, as well as conducting Physics Olympiad training. Apart from teaching Physics, I am also an enthusiastic Project Work (PW) Supervising Tutor  (ST), helping students to understand real life problems and how to address them in a feasible and manageable manner. I am also heavily involved in developing PW teaching and learning resources, crafting lectures and mentoring new STs.

I was also fortunate to helm the SAF-Schools Partnership Programme whereby I worked closely with our military partners to craft many meaningful experiences for students. I also drive National Education (NE) efforts by crafting an innovative NE trail for students. My greatest affirmation for my contribution in Character and Citizenship Education was receiving the Outstanding Contribution Award (Individual) in 2013.

The words of Aristotle resonate with me and I believe that “education is the best provision for old age”. In my role as an educator, I want to help students develop the skill of learning, unlearning and relearning for life. I am really excited to join the Eunoia family in creating a dynamic learning environment.

I have three lively boys and I enjoy spending outdoor time with them.
