I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature (Second Upper Honours) from the National University of Singapore (NUS), as part of the NUS University Scholars Programme. In 2015, I was awarded the Inspiring Teacher of English Award for igniting a passion in language and literature.

I began my career teaching both General Paper and Literature in English at a junior college for three years before specialising in Literature for another five years. In total, I have guided six consecutive cohorts of students to the A Level Examination, serving as covering Subject Head of Literature for three years and crystallising the department’s curriculum, assessment and pedagogy. From 2013 to 2015, I took on the role of teaching mentor to teachers within the department. I would say that my proudest moments as an educator do not come from tributes, gifts or the applause after a lecture from my students. In fact, I feel most accomplished when I see my students grow in their love for the subject, their sensitivity to language and in their creative and critical abilities.

“Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” I believe that education is about seeing beyond oneself to learn about and care about the world around us. It is about nourishing a love for learning, to spread one’s passion and to see more clearly because of it. With clear eyes and full hearts, students would be able to build something bigger than themselves.

At my previous college, I led a rebranding exercise that extended from a student vision to a wide range of identity elements, including house identities, uniform elements, outreach publications and not least the school crest. I relish the challenge of creating a college culture that will do justice to three schools steeped in tradition and excellence. I cannot wait to see our students wear their college uniform and apparel with pride, and project the purpose, heart and courage that is part of the college vision to their peers, their communities and the rest of Singapore.

_Marc joined the college as a pioneering Head of Department in 2016._
