I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Social Sciences (Second Lower Honours) in Economics. I yearned to deepen my knowledge and skills in the subject and a few years later, was able to pursue a Master of Science degree in Economics at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

After being awarded a postgraduate diploma at the National Institute of Education, I started my teaching career in a junior college where I had the opportunity to teach Economics at H1 and H2 levels. My experience as an educator has been enriching and has helped me to shape me into a genuine teacher. A good education is not about rote memorisation, blind regurgitation and knowledge force-feeding. I often reflect on how to create a nurturing and enlivening environment in the classroom, where I provide the conditions for students to learn and achieve their potential. I find that students also inspire me greatly when we bounce off ideas with one another. As the Singapore economy transforms from a manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge-based one, it is crucial to develop these critical thinking and creativity skills for students to thrive in the 21st century workforce.

My favourite quote as an educator is inspired by James Truslow Adams: “There are two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live.” This is in line with Eunoia’s college ethos. I look forward to inspiring Eunoians in this manner!
