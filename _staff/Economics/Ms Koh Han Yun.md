I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Economics and Geography from the University College of London (UCL), and a Master of Science (MSc) in Economics from The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). Pursuing these degrees allowed me to satisfy my inherent curiosity about human behaviour and its interaction with society, the economy and the environment.

Before joining Eunoia Junior College, I taught Economics at another junior college (JC), also offering the Integrated Programme. My passion in teaching stems from my strong belief in the value of education. I had personally benefited from Singapore’s education system, which I believe to a large extent to be a social leveller.

I enjoy working with students as they develop holistically in various academic disciplines and Co-Curricular Activities and more importantly, discover their interests, identity and life goals. Working with JC students is as challenging as it is exciting, as both teachers and students gear up for the A-level examination. In returning to teaching after spending two years in policy work at the Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Higher Education and Skills Group, I look forward to journeying with many more batches of students. As the saying goes, “A teacher takes a hand, opens a mind, and touches a heart.” I have made it a personal and professional challenge to touch as many hearts as the minds I open. After all, the A-level examination is not an end in itself, but one of the many doors to abundant opportunities ahead.

I am excited to be part of the Eunoian family and its pioneering work of grooming generations of Youth with Purpose, Thinkers with Heart, and Leaders with Courage. Coincidentally, the meaning of Eunoia – Beautiful Thinking, Goodwill to Others, resonates with one of my favourite quotes by film and fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn. “For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.”
