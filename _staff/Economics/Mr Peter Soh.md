I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Economics (Second Upper Honours) in Economics. Later, I graduated on a scholarship from Nanyang Technological University with a Master of Arts degree in Contemporary China.

Prior to joining the Ministry of Education, my career spanned more than a decade in both public and private sectors, including research on the Singapore and regional economies. Since making a mid-career switch to teaching, I taught Economics to students across many junior colleges. In my free time, I like hiking outdoors and taking photos and videos of interesting flora and fauna.

As an educator, I believe in empowering our students to assess real-world issues through an economic lens and from various perspectives. I believe in balancing critical thinking and judgement with empathy. This is part of a larger mission in moulding the future of our nation for an increasingly volatile, complex, uncertain and ambiguous future, where decision-making is often constrained by limited information, less-than-ideal circumstances and by cognitive biases. In this, I am privileged to be a part of Eunoia Junior College’s effort to cultivate in each of our students beautiful thinking and goodwill to all.
