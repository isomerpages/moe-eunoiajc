I graduated from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) with a Bachelor of Science in Economics (Second Class Honours, Upper Division). I had the opportunity to study courses such as Political Economics where I learnt about game strategy in election contexts. After three years in London, I decided to further my studies in the United States and graduated with a Master of Arts in Economics, from Boston University. During my year there, I focused on Industrial Economics to deepen my understanding of market structures and strategies, which is a core topic in the H2 Economic syllabus.

During my stint in the National Institute of Education (NIE), I was told to think about a metaphor which encapsulates my teaching philosophy. I have chosen the metaphor of the Kite Runner, which is based off Khaled Hosseini’s book of the same title. It is important that I help my students achieve greater heights through their educational journey. This must be a gradual process which takes time and momentum, just like how we lift the kite up into the sky. And of course, if the kite gets loose and flies away, I must run and chase after it!

My strong belief is that curiosity drives learning. Through my economic lessons, I hope I can inspire students to be more curious about the world they live in. I facilitate this by adopting an inquiry-based approach, asking my students to think and wonder about current affairs that are happening in the world. For example, “Why is there a rise in anti-globalisation sentiments in recent times? Does this mean the economic theories supporting globalisation are no longer right? Is this a change for the better or worse?” Hopefully, the students will become concerned and critical citizens, ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow and improve the lives of everyone around them.

I am both an indoor and outdoor person. I enjoy spending my weekends reading books and watching movies in the comfort of my house, while enjoying a cup of freshly brewed coffee. Alternatively, I run occasionally at the park connectors near my home. I have picked up long distance running recently, as I believe that it instils discipline and perseverance.
