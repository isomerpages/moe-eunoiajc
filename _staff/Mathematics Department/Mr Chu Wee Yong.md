I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Mathematics. Upon graduation, I pursued a Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education (NIE), under the Public Service Commission (PSC) teaching scholarship. Passionate in the teaching of Mathematics, I have stayed in the education service for more than 20 years, imparting my skills and inspiring students to see the beauty of Mathematics.

I first started teaching in a junior college. For the two decades I was there, apart from the management and leadership opportunities which I was given, I particularly appreciate the strong friendships forged with colleagues who are always there to provide moral wisdom and share the joy of teaching. I also had the opportunity to teach in another junior college for a brief but memorable period, where I learnt to value integrity, unity, humility and above all, trust for one another.

Simplicity is the key to my effective teaching. Though it can be challenging, I always strive to make mathematical concepts simple to understand and difficult problems easy to solve. My lessons are often light-hearted, for I believe that superior learning takes place when classroom experiences are enjoyable. I have always stayed true to my life philosophy that every problem has a solution, and that if we persevere, we can always find the solution. This sentiment has also been echoed by Paulo Coelho, in _The Alchemist_, that "when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it." It is also in this spirit, that I always inspire my students to face challenges in life with positive thinking and to realise that fear is sometimes a bigger obstacle than the obstacle itself.

Outside school, I enjoy working out, to keep myself physically fit and mentally healthy. Music also plays an important part in my life. I perform regularly, playing the flute in Flute Festival Orchestra and the viola in Arpeggione Quartet and Musicians Society of Singapore Symphony Orchestra. In an effort to give back to society, I have been actively volunteering in The Purple Symphony, rendering my musical expertise to help violists with special needs. With music being closely related to Mathematics, I hope to continue exploring ways to integrate the aesthetics of music into my teaching of Mathematics at Eunoia Junior College.
