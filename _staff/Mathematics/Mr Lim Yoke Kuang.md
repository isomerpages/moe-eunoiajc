<p>I graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2008 with a Bachelor
of Science (First Class Honours), majoring in both Physics and Mathematics,
and did a number of electives in computing.&nbsp; Thereafter, I joined
the Ministry of Education and started my initial stint in teaching as a
contract teacher, which further inspired me to join the teaching service
to share my passion and knowledge with others.</p>
<p>After completing my Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National
Institute of Education in 2011, I spent another twelve years teaching at
a junior college, where I had the privilege of teaching Mathematics for
a diverse profile of students at the H1, H2 and H3 levels. &nbsp;To enrich
my teaching experience, I also had the opportunity to take on the role
of the H3 Math Subject IC, and my work included administrative planning
and collaborating with another junior college to develop learning and lesson
resources for the subject.&nbsp; Over the years of my teaching practice,
I realise that students differ as learners in many ways, whether in prior
knowledge, background experience, interests, readiness to learn, modes
of learning and speed of learning, self-awareness, confidence and independence
as a learner, support systems for learning, language, culture, and so on.</p>
<p>These differences profoundly affect how students learn and the nature
of the scaffolding that is needed in the learning process. &nbsp;And because
there is variability among any group of learners, I appreciate the need
to adapt my instructional approach to better meet learning needs that could
vary. &nbsp;Proactive plans to cater for diverse learning needs will always
be a work-in-progress –– and as the renowned pioneer and expert in differentiated
instruction Professor Carol Ann Tomlinson so aptly puts, “A teacher in
a differentiated classroom does not classify herself as someone who ‘already
differentiates instruction.’ Rather that teacher is fully aware that every
hour of teaching, every day in the classroom can reveal one more way to
make the classroom a better match for its learners.” I am excited to join
the Eunoia community, and look forward to being more intentional and adaptive
in providing differentiated instruction for students, to create a more
dynamic, responsive and effective learning environment that meets diverse
learning needs.</p>
<p>I also believe that the heart of our education in life is the nurturance
and development of inner seeds of kindness, mercy, compassion and great
wisdom that each of us share with one another deeply within.&nbsp; This
is a process that accompanies a gradual understanding of the deep interconnectedness
that each of us share with one another despite the apparent differences
that we may have, and this is also a process that goes along with a gradual
appreciation of the ancient Golden Rule, which teaches us to “do unto others
as what we would like others do unto us”, because when we try to benefit
others we are also doing ourselves a service.</p>
