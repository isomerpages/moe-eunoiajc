I graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2012 with a Bachelor of Science (Second Upper Class Honours), majoring in Applied Mathematics as a MOE Teaching Award holder. Following that, I completed my Postgraduate Diploma in Education (JC) for the subject of Mathematics at the National Institute of Education in 2013.

I started my teaching career in 2013 at a junior college, teaching Mathematics at H1 and H2 levels for close to five years. In addition, I was given the opportunity to teach Project Work and was involved in the assessment of the Oral Presentation component. I was also appointed the Student-Council Teacher Advisor to develop potential leaders amongst the student population through various programmes such as Orientation, Student Council Investiture, Graduation Night, overseas Values in Action projects and Cultural Immersion trips. To broaden my experience in the education landscape, I crossed over to a secondary school in 2018 to teach Mathematics and Additional Mathematics for three years before coming to Eunoia Junior College. The experiences that I garnered over the years allowed me to better understand the struggles that students face in their academic progress as they transit from secondary education to tertiary education, and to better support them both academically and emotionally.

My teaching philosophy is, “Every student can learn”. I recognise that every student is unique and learns in different ways. In my opinion, learning should never be uni-directional. I believe in social constructivism and seek to co-construct knowledge together with my students. I hope to inspire Eunoians to always remain curious and experience the joy of learning. This would help encourage them to learn beyond the classroom and make learning a life-long habit. With the belief that learning can occur anytime and anywhere, I look forward to learning from and _with_ my students.

Outside of teaching, I engage in a variety of activities. I love to bring my dog for long walks and hikes. I also find joy in singing and swimming.  My biggest interest is to travel as a backpacker to interact with the locals and learn more about their way of life.

I am grateful and excited to be given the opportunity to start a new chapter of my teaching journey at Eunoia Junior College. I hope to contribute to the college and grow together with my fellow colleagues and students as one Eunoia family.
