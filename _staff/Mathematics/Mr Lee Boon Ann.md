I graduated from National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Mathematics and the University of Leeds, United Kingdom, where I had my teacher training. I attended both courses on Public Service Commission scholarships. The year in Leeds opened my eyes to other ways of doing things, challenging the norms and assumptions we are so used to.

I spent sixteen years teaching in a junior college. During that time, I was involved with its integrated programme and A-level Project Work and feel privileged to have been involved in both right from their respective beginnings. I have taught Mathematics at both GCE ‘A’ Level and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). My experience with IBDP in a specialised school and an international school was similarly eye-opening for me.

For over twenty years in teaching, I have always believed that learning is a continual process as there is no real end-point to learning. End-points are merely checkpoints in disguise – a rest stop before the next journey. With the right attitude and effort, each journey, however challenging, can be fulfilling. The opportunity to help build a learning and collaborative culture at Eunoia is exciting.

I enjoy spending time with my family, particularly my three children. There is so much to learn from them. My daughter once told me that it does not matter where we go for holidays as long as we spend the time together.
