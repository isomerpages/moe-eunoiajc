<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) in Mathematical
Sciences from Nanyang Technological University, and was awarded the Lee
Kuan Yew Gold Medal and the Koh Boon Hwee Scholars Award for being the
top student in the course. During my undergraduate years, one highlight
was my exchange experience at the University of Waterloo where many Mathematics
professors chose to teach students using chalkboards. It was amazing how
they engaged us with their wit, humour and passion without the aid of technology.
I learnt to focus on the fundamentals of good teaching and that technology
by itself will not replace good teaching.</p>
<p>I started out teaching in a secondary school, teaching students Mathematics
across 3 streams and 4 levels. I also taught students H1, H2 and H3 Mathematics
at another junior college before joining Eunoia. Working alongside students
of different profiles and readiness, I came to realise that students are
more alike than different in learning Mathematics. We feel an immense sense
of satisfaction, or relief, when a difficult concept eventually clicked
and when we finally solve a challenging problem. We also experience similar
struggles such as the inertia to get started and the temptation to give
up. As a teacher, I strive to know my students and work with them to strengthen
their belief, mindset and character so that they have the confidence to
dream big, the patience to strive towards their dreams and the fortitude
to persevere through adversity.</p>
<p>In my previous school, I had the opportunity to lead the Ultimate Frisbee
co-curricular activity (CCA) and it was an illuminating learning experience.
It was a time when Ultimate was transiting from an interest group into
a full-fledged CCA and in less than six months, we were playing against
more established teams in the Inter-Junior College Tournament. The students
had aspirations and they worked relentlessly in the pursuit of their goals.
They dug deep and pushed their physical limits, growing from individuals
with little to no experience in Ultimate to a skilful, disciplined and
close-knit team who became a force to be reckoned with. We eventually achieved
second position in the tournament and continued to attain podium position
for the next two years. This experience is a constant reminder to me that
students can achieve remarkable feats when they dream big and devote consistent
effort to the processes.</p>
<p>I am grateful to join the Eunoia family and I look forward to working
and learning with Eunoians through all the highs and low of their A-Level
journey.</p>
