I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese Studies (Second Upper Honours) from the National University of Singapore. In 2008, I completed a Master of Arts in Contemporary China at the Nanyang Technological University.

I began my teaching career at a junior college in 2003, teaching H1 Chinese, H2 China Studies in Chinese, and H1 Project Work. As the Subject Head of Chinese Language, I helped to set up the nation’s fourth Chinese Language Elective Programme Centre, a role which included conducting outreach talks at secondary schools, organising Ministry of Education-wide camps, and leading overseas immersion trips to China. Before joining Eunoia Junior College, I served as a Senior Curriculum Planning Officer in the Mother Tongue Languages Branch, and worked on the Bicultural Studies Programme and China Studies in Chinese. As the officer-in-charge of China Studies in Chinese, I worked on the full-term review of the new syllabus, which is being implemented in 2016.

There is a Chinese saying that it takes ten years to grow a tree and a hundred years to groom a talent (十年树木, 百年树人). Education is indeed a route which requires many generations to accomplish. I am very grateful to the education service for nurturing me as a student, and for providing me numerous learning opportunities as a teacher. Heading the Mother Tongue Languages Department and Bicultural Studies Programme at Eunoia Junior College will allow me to continue to learn, to nurture and to contribute to the education system.
