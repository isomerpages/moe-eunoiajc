I graduated from the National University of Singapore, majoring Chinese Studies and Chinese Language. I then started my teaching career in an Integrated Programme school, where I taught in both the junior and senior high sections. I went on to pursue a Master’s Degree in Teaching of Chinese as a Second Language in Taiwan after a few years, and subsequently worked on developing various Chinese curriculums in the Ministry of Education HQ before joining the Eunoia family.

As a former chorister myself, I hope to share my love for choral singing with the EJC Choir, where they will not only create beautiful music together, but also forge camaraderie and lasting friendships.

I firmly believe that everyone can be bilingual, for Singapore is blessed with a multilingual environment. I hope that in Eunoia, we can create an environment where the learning of both English and Mother Tongue Languages are fun and challenging, enabling Eunoians to connect with people and soar with ease no matter where their future lies.
