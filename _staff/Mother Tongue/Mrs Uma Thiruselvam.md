I started off my journey as a Tamil Language teacher in a secondary school, having taught Basic Tamil Language, Tamil Language and Higher Tamil Language across all levels and streams. Apart from teaching academic subjects, I am a strong believer and advocate of values. I enjoy organising and being part of service learning projects and community service with my students, which led me to receive a Commendation note from our former Minister of Education, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam in 2005.  I am also humbled to have received the Outstanding Contribution Award twice in 2010 and 2012.

I attained my Master of Education in Tamil Language from the National Institute of Education. Subsequently I was attached to MOE HQ’s Educational Technology Division for four years which allowed me to pursue my interests of media production. My attachment helped me grow professionally working with people from various groups which broadened my thinking.

My passion for the language is further enriched through my involvement in Tamil theatre for the past 20 years. As an active theatre practitioner, I have directed plays and headed the team that inaugurated children’s theatre in Tamil, in Singapore.  My flair for script-writing led me to a Best Script Award as well as given me the passion to steer my students to clinch the top prize for the National Tamil Drama Competition, for three consecutive years.

As a member of the Eunoia family, I am excited and look forward to inculcate the following mantra to my students: ‘Education is not a Destination, but a Journey!’
