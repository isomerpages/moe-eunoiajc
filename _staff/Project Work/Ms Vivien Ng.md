<p>I graduated&nbsp;from the National University of Singapore&nbsp;with a
Bachelor&nbsp;of Engineering (Second Upper Honours)&nbsp;in Chemical Engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
graduation,&nbsp;I&nbsp;joined&nbsp;a multinational semiconductor&nbsp;manufacturing
company as a process engineer; working on yield enhancements and cost improvement
projects. I enjoyed the dynamism of the industry&nbsp;as well as the opportunities
to participate in state of the art technology development.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;from
my&nbsp;prior&nbsp;mentoring experiences with youth organisations&nbsp;when
I was a student volunteer,&nbsp;I knew deep down&nbsp;that&nbsp;I wanted
to do a work that had greater&nbsp;and more&nbsp;direct impact on young
people.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp;I decided on a career switch to pursue teaching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;first junior college I taught in provided me the privilege to
work with both students from the Integrated Programme as well as JC programme.&nbsp;
7 years teaching in the college helped me to grow in my capacity as a teacher
and helped me ascertain my calling as a teacher. &nbsp;There were many
Kodak moments in my time there but my fondest memories were definitely
the one to one sessions I shared with my students where I could engage
in deep, open conversations with them. &nbsp;Knowing and understanding
what my students were going through, sharing my personal experiences with
them, journeying with them through the ups and downs of their college life
and eventually seeing them grow in confidence of their abilities and achieving
their dreams brought me immense satisfaction.</p>
<p>I took a break from teaching for a couple of years in 2017 to accompany
my spouse on his overseas posting.&nbsp; Being a stay-at-home mum to 3
young children in a foreign country was a daunting challenge. It was during
this time that I learnt the importance of relationships and to value it
above all else. The new friends I made overseas became my strong support
group, who made my time away from home “just that bit” more enjoyable and
fulfilling.&nbsp; Now back in Singapore, I am excited to resume teaching
here in Eunoia Junior College.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with the quote by Brad Henry, “A good&nbsp;teacher&nbsp;can inspire
hope, ignite the imagination, and instil a love of learning”.&nbsp; I strongly
believe that a teacher can indeed inspire students to love a subject and
I constantly strive to make my classroom a safe place where students can
and want to learn.&nbsp; Beyond academics, I also believe that a teacher
can positively influence and mould the character of students.&nbsp; Being
there for them and coaching them through the lowest points of their student
lives emphasizes the importance of care for people and also helps to develop
tenacity and builds resilience in them.&nbsp; It is my desire to see graduating
students leave with not only a good set of results but more importantly,
to do so with a group of good friends that will embark with them through
the challenges in life that lies ahead.&nbsp; My greatest hope for the
younger generation is that they will not only live for themselves but rather
strive to make the lives of others around them “just that bit” better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
