<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Faculty of Arts and
Social Sciences, National University of Singapore in 2003, majoring in
English Language and Sociology with a minor in English Literature. In 2016,
I advanced my higher education at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,
University of Sydney and graduated with a Master of Education in Management
and Leadership.</p>
<p>A fourteen-year career in education has seen me traversing secondary,
pre-university and tertiary institutions, taking on responsibilities of
various capacity. My longest and most recent stint would be my time as
a General Paper and English Language and Linguistics educator in a junior
college. As Subject Head of English Language, I was privileged to be at
the helm of college-wide projects which have gained good traction since
my departure. I consider my inaugural roles in institutionalising the H2
English Language and Linguistics curriculum, a school-wide interdisciplinary
literacy programme as well as providing pragmatic language support to both
staff and students through a centralised College Secretariat as key milestones
in my career. With a core value of service towards all whose paths cross
mine and an innate desire to better the lives of both students and teachers
alike, such assignments have afforded me a strong sense of purpose and
responsibility towards those who walk the same educational journey as me.
As an English educator, I also take strong comfort in how students of mine,
regardless of their academic performance, have been inspired enough to
also carve out their careers in English Language teaching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue
that counts.” – Sir Winston Churchill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple as it reads, profound in its practice. This quote by Sir Winston
Churchill aptly embodies my personal philosophy as an educator. Not having
failed is tantamount to not having learnt. It is my strong belief that
every rational, living being desires growth and such can be exponential
in the presence of 3 Es - Encountering, Empowering, Enabling. As educators,
we must constantly immerse our charges (both students and fellow educators)
in good educational encounters, empower them to make decisions autonomously,
and enable them to excel in their duties with rigorous mentorship and guidance.</p>
<p>Time is a luxury in education but when I do have some at my disposal,
travelling to somewhere remote, hosting tea parties at home, getting my
fingers dirty at an organic farm or dabbling in alternative medicine are
my top choices.</p>
<p>I have committed myself to EJC because I have been a beneficiary of the
3 Es aforementioned. I look forward to experiencing continual growth as
much as I enable others to grow alongside me in times ahead.</p>
