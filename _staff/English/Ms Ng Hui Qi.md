I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature (Second Upper Honours) from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2015. In the process of writing my undergraduate thesis, I studied how humour can transcend boundaries and make a text accessible and enjoyable for both children and adult readers. I believe that laughter can lead to deeper thought, as the “aha” moment is not far from the “haha” response, and I look forward to sharing such moments with my students.

While my first Curriculum Subject is General Paper and my second CS is English Literature, I am interested in exploring the ways in which I can incorporate elements of Literature in teaching GP. From asking students to consider the narratives projected by certain communities in order to express their identities, to analysing how a writer might craft his or her argumentative essay, I hope to show students how the world is our text. General Paper, after all, is not about memorising facts and news events, but about understanding the narrative behind these events.

Similarly, in thinking about our growth as a narrative in progress, I would like my students to believe in their autonomy to write their own story. At the end of this chapter of their lives, I hope my students will have made not just memories but meaning out of their experiences.
