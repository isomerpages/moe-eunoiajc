Reading has always been a source of fulfilment for me and I am privileged that I am able to share my passion for Literature today. I strongly believe that Literature can help us understand and interpret the world around us and through its pages, we can walk the lives of many journeys and learn most importantly, about ourselves.

My teaching career began in a secondary school where I taught English Language and English Literature. Under the guidance of inspiring colleagues, it gave me the opportunity to work collaboratively to inculcate in students a love for Literature and the language for all levels and abilities. My experiences there have shaped my teaching belief that every child can discover the joys that Literature can bring. My next posting was to a pre-university institute where I taught Literature in the A-Level classroom. I also had the opportunity to take part in the coaching of the football team to train the physical skills and strength of character in the boys. Through my interactions with my colleagues and my students, I have learned that kindness is just as important in education as hard work and resilience.

I am grateful and excited to join the Eunoia community and to play a role in guiding my students to embrace their opportunities prudently and responsibly.

In my free time, I can be found cleaning the dust bunnies off my board games, chipping away at my pile of unread books or boisterously kicking a football.
