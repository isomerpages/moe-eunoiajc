<p>I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor
of Social Sciences (Second Upper Honours) in Sociology.</p>
<p>Beyond Sociology, the multidisciplinary learning experience in NUS enabled
me to explore my interest in regional studies (Southeast Asia and South
Asia), Social Work and Film Studies. Undergird these different fields of
studies is the appreciation of diversity in the human experience, respect
for the different perspectives that it presents, the willingness to consider
these perspectives and the skillset to be discerning.</p>
<p>Through General Paper, I hope to imbue students with the same enriching
learning experience that will enable them to appreciate the interrelationship
of ideas and become more adept at managing the complexities of the world
we live in.</p>
<p>After a teaching stint in a secondary school, I decided to join the fraternity
by pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute
of Education. I then taught General Paper and Project Work at a junior
college where I was given the responsibility to look after students in
a sports co-curricular activity. It was a truly rewarding experience to
see them grow in confidence and maturity. One of the highlights of my teaching
experience in the junior college was witnessing students grow in strength
as they overcome challenges to emerge National Champions for the National
School Games and to see them apply the same resilience and grit in their
academic pursuits. This experience crystalised my belief that learning
transcends the boundaries of the classroom and that genuine learning comes
about through meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Eunoia Junior College, I was part of the Curriculum Planning
and Development Division (CPDD) teams that oversaw the national curricula
for General Paper and Project Work. I am grateful for the opportunities
in CPDD to design and implement a suite of professional learning offerings
for teachers and develop nation-wide resources to support teaching and
learning.</p>
<p>I hope to apply my experiences to nurture critical thinkers with a passion
for learning and a heart for others. I look forward to learning and growing
together with Eunoians and fellow colleagues.</p>
