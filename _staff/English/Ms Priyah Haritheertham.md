> “I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think.” – Socrates

I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics (Distinction). I also completed the University Town College Programme at Tembusu College, which turned out to be one of the best experiences of my undergraduate years as it opened up my mind to new perspectives and enabled me to form long-lasting friendships. Throughout my college life, I have had the privilege of being taught by the most passionate educators and I aspire to become like them in my journey as an educator.

Even though I have an Economics background, my passion for the English language urged me to become a General Paper teacher instead. Surprisingly, one of the modules I enjoyed the most in my undergraduate years was an introductory module to linguistics. I hope to impart the passion and knowledge I possess for the English language and current affairs to my students. General Paper is an exciting and dynamic subject as it allows me to discuss pertinent issues and current affairs with students, thus developing them into well-informed and reflective citizens. As reflected in the quote above, I hope to get students to think critically about the issues they see in the world today and grow into more mature thinkers. What I enjoy the most about teaching is seeing my students show evidence of learning and genuine reflection, which contributes to their holistic development and affirms my role as an educator.

I look forward to growing as a General Paper teacher in Eunoia, along with the support of my friendly colleagues and experienced subject leaders. I hope to give the best to my students and help them realise their full potential during their time in Eunoia.
