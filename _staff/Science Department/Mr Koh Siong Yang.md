I graduated with a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (Second Upper Honours) from the National University of Singapore. After spending two years working as a product engineer in the semiconductor industry, I realised that I have spent enough time interacting mainly with computers. I decided to give teaching a shot and this was one of the best decisions I have made in my life.

I attained the Postgraduate Diploma in Education awarded by the National Institute of Education (NIE) in 2010 and was posted to a pre-university institute to teach A-Level Physics. As a beginning teacher then, I was glad that I could share my industrial experience with my students and guide them to draw relevance between what they are studying with real life application and context. One of my greatest achievements as an educator was to lead a group of students who have no experience in robotics to take part in the Singapore VEX Robotics Championship. This group of students managed to obtain the gold award for two consecutive years in 2011 and 2012.

I was appointed as the Subject Head of Partnership in 2016 and my involvement in this role enabled me to gain insights into the importance of partnering stakeholders in education. We worked closely with parents to maximise learning potential of our students. We also collaborated with external organisations to provide students with opportunities to learn knowledge, skills and values in authentic settings.

My teaching philosophy has not changed since the day I started teaching. I want teaching and learning to be fun and applicable. I strongly believe that students can maximise their learning in school if teachers put in the effort to infuse the element of “fun” in the classroom to spark the students’ joy of learning. As the Deputy Head (ICT) of Eunoia Junior College, I am excited to be given the opportunity to influence my peers to make their lessons fun too with the help of technology.
