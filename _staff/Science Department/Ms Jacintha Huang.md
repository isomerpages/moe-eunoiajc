I graduated from Nanyang Technological University with a Bachelor of Science (Second Upper Honours) in Chemistry and Biological Chemistry. I then pursued a Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education.

My teaching practice began in a junior college where I taught both Higher 1 and Higher 2 Chemistry. It was a memorable and enriching experience. Teaching students from diverse backgrounds help developed my repertoire of pedagogies. I led my colleagues in the role of a coordinator, developing materials to address the students’ learning needs. I was also part of a team that developed full team-based learning for the H1 cohort. Following that, I participated in a Teacher-Training Programme offered by the Japanese Government (MEXT) where I studied educational methods and curriculum, researched in the teaching of Nature of Science. Through these experiences, I have gained more insights into how 21st-century competencies such as critical thinking skills can be nurtured in students.

I strongly believe that a school is a place not only for mastering disciplinary content but also for skills and values, crucial to navigate in this increasingly complex world, to be inculcated. Through my teaching and interaction with students, I hope to instil in students good moral values and habits while nurturing a joy of learning and growth.

One of my interests is music. I was in the symphonic band from primary two and played the piano and flute through my schooling years. I even took up voice training for a short period of time. Other than music, Japanese culture also fascinates me such that I took up the Japanese Language which became an advantage for my research programme in Japan.

I look forward to creating fond memories, growing and developing together with the Eunoia family.
