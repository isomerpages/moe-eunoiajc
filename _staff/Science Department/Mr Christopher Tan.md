I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Chemistry, and completed a Master in Education (Gifted Education) from the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University and a Master in Science (Material Science & Engineering) from the National University of Singapore.

My teaching career started in a secondary school.  After which, I had the opportunity to work in the Special Education Branch, MOE HQ, and subsequently went on to teach Chemistry at A-level in an Integrated Programme (IP) institution and junior colleges.

In my career, I have taught Chemistry at various levels.  Throughout the years in my teaching service in an IP school and junior colleges, I held positions as Programme Head (Talent Development – Science, Math & Humanities) and Department Head (Instructional Programme), and had been co-ordinator and teacher-mentor for various programmes such as the STEM Nexus, Science Enrichment and Chemistry Olympiad training.

Having been an educator for more than 20 years, I believe that all students have their own innate potential and talent.  They each have their unique personality, and everyone deserves to have the opportunity to learn and excel at his or her own pace.  We are all embarking on a learning journey, and for students especially, are all works in progress.

It is pertinent for students to think and ask questions, to have a sense of awe and wonder, which is fundamental to teaching and learning. I see the importance of having the joy of learning, both for educators and students. The challenge remains to search for the key to unlock this, so as to bring about the joy and motivation in teaching and learning for everyone.

The interactions with many generous and big-hearted educators in my learning journey have enriched me, and in turn I am happy to share my knowledge and experiences with fellow teachers.  I believe that active participating, sharing and learning can be impactful and beneficial to the professional development for both the individual teacher and the teaching fraternity.

It is my heartfelt wish that my contribution as part of the Eunoia family will be enriching and rewarding, for myself, my colleagues and all the students.
