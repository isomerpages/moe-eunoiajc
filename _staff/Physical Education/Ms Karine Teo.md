I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science in Food Science and Technology. My career started in the food manufacturing and retail industry for 6 years. Thereafter, I completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Education with the National Institute of Education.

I was the chairperson for my local community club’s Youth Executive Committee for three consecutive terms where I led a team of youth between 15 and 35 years old to harness their strengths and channel their positive energy. Together, we created meaningful projects to benefit the community.

During this time, we won the Most Improved Youth Club, Meritorious Youth Club and Outstanding Project from the People’s Association Youth Movement. I was also honoured to receive the Individual Youth Award (Meritorious). The enriching experience in youth development was one of the main factors that spurred me to take on teaching as a second career.

I like adventure and learning new things. Outside teaching, I play a variety of sports and embark on nature.

It is a rare opportunity to be part of something new. Hence, I relish the challenge involved in building Eunoia and look forward to embarking on this journey.
