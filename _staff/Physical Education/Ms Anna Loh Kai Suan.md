I graduated with Bachelor of Arts from the National University of Singapore, majoring in Sociology and English, and a Master of Science (Sports Science) from Nanyang Technological University.

I have taught in three schools – a junior college, a secondary school and an integrated programme school. I spent 11 years at the integrated programme school. When the school started the integrated programme, I helped to spearhead the PE department (Junior College section) and worked with the Head of Character & Citizenship Education set up the National Education committee. I was also in charge of the Senior High learning journeys and dialogue sessions with top civil servants. Furthermore, I started the Floorball ‘A’ Division Girls team, which has achieved many top-four finishes since its conceptualisation in 2009.

I live by the following quotation by Robert John Meehan: ‘Every child has a different learning style and pace. Each child is unique, not only capable of learning but also capable of succeeding.’

I love to go to the outdoors with my family. Running at the park with my corgi while my children skate is also one of my way of winding down. I love to cook and bake, especially artisan bread. To cook for my family and friends brings me immense joy. I am energetic and full of life. The glass tends to be always half full rather than half empty for me.

_Kai Suan joined the college as a pioneering member of staff in 2017._
