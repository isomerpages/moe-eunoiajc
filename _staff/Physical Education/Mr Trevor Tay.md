I served as a combat officer in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) for 16 years before making the career switch to teaching. I was awarded the SAF Academic Training Award (Local) in 1992 and studied Civil Engineering in the National University of Singapore, graduating with first class honours in 1996. Some of the appointments I held in the SAF included instructor in Officer Cadet School, Company Commander and staff officer in the Army Human Resource Department.

Sports and outdoor activities played a significant part in my life and I relished the opportunity to offer similar experiences to our youths. Hence, I decided to teach. I completed my Postgraduate Diploma in Physical Education at the National Institute of Education in 2009 and taught in a junior college afterwards for 8 years. I helmed the Outdoor Activities Club and offered students a range of outdoor experiences, as well as guided in the planning and organisation of camps and local / overseas expeditions. I aided the establishment of an Ultimate Frisbee team which has since been most popular amongst the students. I also guided students in the organisation of numerous college projects, such as SG50 celebrations, beach clean-up and charity road runs. I believe that sports, outdoor activities and student-led projects provide authentic opportunities for our students to learn about themselves and develop their character. I seek to imbue in my students an adventurous spirit and a strong “can do” attitude, anchored on diligence and personal pride. It will hopefully inspire and empower them to make a positive difference in all their endeavours.

I am deeply drawn to the Eunoia vision of “Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage”. It lends confidence in the institution that I will be part of and purpose in what I will be striving towards. I look forward to a meaningful journey with the college and making a difference to our students.
