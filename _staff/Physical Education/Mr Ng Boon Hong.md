There are two passions that drive me — animal welfare, as well as health and fitness. The former guided me through my early years in education, giving me the impetus to pursue an animal-related degree. In 2014, I graduated from National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor’s degree (Hons) in Life Sciences, specialising in Environmental Biology. Subsequently, I worked for three years with Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS), first as an aquarist, before moving on to be a Zookeeper at River Safari. It was a privilege to be able to get in close proximity with majestic beasts that people often only see on screens. It was an enriching period of time when I learnt not just to connect to the animals, but with visitors and colleagues too.

Throughout my student and work life, sports continued to play a huge role. In 2017, I decided to pursue my second passion of health and fitness. Their importance cannot be emphasised more. As Mr. John F. Kennedy mentioned:

> _"Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basis of dynamic and creative intellectual activity."_

I hope more people would be able to understand this concept, and what better way than to start when they were young. Hence, I decided to enrol in the Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) in National Institute of Education (NIE) with the intention of teaching Physical Education (PE). I graduate in 2020.

Being in Eunoia Junior College presents me the first opportunity to teach at a Pre-University level, having had relief teaching experience at primary schools, as well as stints in various secondary schools. The college’s values of ‘Living with Integrity, Connecting with Love, Leading Courageously and Serving Selflessly’ resonate strongly with me. I am excited to challenge our fine ladies and gentlemen to learn more about themselves and to be more aware of ways to keep themselves healthy while they pursue their own passions and becoming honest, loving, brave and selfless leaders in their own rights.
