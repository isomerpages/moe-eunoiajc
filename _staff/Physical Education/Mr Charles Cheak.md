I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Sociology in 2004, before entering the National Institute of Education to complete my Postgraduate Diploma in Education in Physical Education in 2007. In Jan 2014, I embarked on a Master of Science (Exercise and Sports Studies) and graduated in 2016.

I have been the Subject Head of Co-Curricular Activities since 2011 in my previous school, having led its Basketball team since 2008 and also having managed two combined concerts held at the National Drama Centre and Lasalle College of the Arts. I am most passionate about creating an authentic experience for students where they are able to discover their own passions, to create a platform for success but also a cushion for failure. We need to provide an environment where students succeed and fail in a safe environment to prepare them for an uncertain future when they graduate.

I believe that education trains the mind, and is not determined by achievements or awards. Learning and enjoyment can take place simultaneously: we need to find that balance and plan lessons such that students find enjoyment in tough training and learning in play.

The formation of Eunoia Junior College represented a chance for me to give back to my _alma mater_ Catholic High School and at the same time, be a part of a pioneering staff who will play a part in building and shaping the culture. I would like to be part of this once in a lifetime experience and also to see if the processes that I have created in my previous experience can work and if it is transferable.

_Charles joined the college as a pioneering member of staff in 2017._
