I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science (Second Upper Honours) on a Public Service Commission Teaching scholarship, majoring in Mathematics.

My teaching career started in a junior college in 2007 where I had opportunities to teach Mathematics at H1, H2 and H3 levels, as well as Project Work. As an educator, I am constantly thinking of ways to engage the students’ minds and nothing is more fulfilling than having students finally grasp a difficult Mathematical concept after grappling with it. It is my hope that through Mathematics, students learn that with hard work, strategy and perseverance, we can tackle the many problems that we encounter in life. I also had the opportunities to lead Co-Curricular Activities such as Canoeing and House Council, where I learned important values – such as the pursuit of excellence and perseverance – from my students as much as they learnt from me.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing kayaking, cross-fitness and gym training to keep fit. I also love all things Thai, having spent three months living and teaching English in Thailand.

Joining a new junior college as Head of Department of Mathematics is an amazing and rare opportunity that I could not pass up; the bold vision that Eunoia Junior College has for her students is inspiring, and the dynamic and close-knit family of teachers motivate each other to push on beyond our limits. My team of dedicated Mathematics teachers and I strive to provide a rich learning Mathematics experience for the students, together with the students, to make the learning of Mathematics a fulfilling and meaningful journey for all Eunoians.
