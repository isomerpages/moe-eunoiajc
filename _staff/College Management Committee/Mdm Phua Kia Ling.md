<p>As cliché as it sounds, it was my Chinese language (CL) primary school
teacher who gave me a life-changing experience, taking a leap of faith
to push a shy and introverted 12-year-old girl onto the stage to participate
in a storytelling competition. Much to everyone’s surprise, this girl came
in first, the rest is history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am blessed to come across very dedicated and knowledgeable Chinese language
teachers throughout my primary school days to junior college life. They
were the ones who ignited my love and passion for Chinese literature. It
seemed a natural decision for me to major in Chinese Language and Literature
for my undergraduate studies at the National University of Singapore, where
I graduated with Second Class Honours (Upper Division). After working as
a reporter with a Chinese student publication, I followed my inner voice
and made the decision to join the teaching fraternity, a choice I have
never regretted over the past 20 years. After completing my three-year
stint at a junior college as a beginning teacher, I embarked on a postgraduate
study to learn more about special education at the University of Western
Australia, and I received a Master of Education with Honours. While special
needs was not yet a fully explored educational area in early-2000s Singapore,
the learning journey deepened my conviction to build an inclusive learning
environment upon returning home. I am glad that this aspiration is gradually
becoming a reality in our classrooms today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2008, I pursued another Master’s programme at Peking University
on an MOE Postgraduate Scholarship, specialising in modern Chinese literature.&nbsp;
Upon completing my studies, I served a four-year stint at the Curriculum
Planning &amp; Development Division of MOE HQ. The experiences in both
Australia and China allowed me to appreciate the beauty and diversity of
both the Western and Chinese culture, and there is still so much for me
to acquire and see beyond the world. Believing that an understanding of
different cultures bridges differences and fosters better communication,
I have consciously made an effort to ensure this form a part of the curriculum
planning when I was with an integrated programme school and a mainstream
secondary school as the Head of Department (Mother Tongue Languages) from
2011 to 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first Vice-Principalship was at a primary school in 2019, working closely
with like-minded educators to co-create a balanced and holistic education
for every student. This humbling experience reinforced my belief in the
significant impact teachers have on young learners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a strong believer in purposeful and lifelong learning, I made a recent
pitstop at the National Institute of Education to pursue a Master of Arts
in Educational Management, which was refreshing and rejuvenating – a time
to reflect and a time to rest. Over the coming years in Eunoia, I am ready
to co-construct and learn from all of you in the spirit of Beautiful Thinking,
Goodwill to All!</p>
