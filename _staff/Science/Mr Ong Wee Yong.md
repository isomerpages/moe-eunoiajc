I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor of Science with Honours (Second Upper Class) in Chemistry in 2013, before going on to complete my Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education in 2014. After teaching for a few years, I chose to pursue my graduate studies at the National Institute of Education. Driven by my interest in the social sciences, I chose to pursue a Master of Arts, where I focused on researching the challenges faced by international students using a critical lens, and graduated in 2018.

I started my teaching career at an independent school, where I taught H2, H3, and university-level Chemistry for six and a half years. During this time, I also had the opportunity to train students for a number of competitions, such as the Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad, the National Science Challenge, and the International Chemistry Tournament. Through these experiences, I discovered that the joy I see in my students’ eyes when they understand new concepts and achieve breakthroughs, both in Chemistry and in life, continues to motivate me in what I do. It is also critically important to me that students are equipped to find their mission and purpose in life. Helping students find out why they are studying so hard and what value they can create in the future has become a significant part of my teaching philosophy.

Outside of teaching, the arts play an important part in my life. I played the flute and piccolo for ten years and produced ‘Beauty World’, the maiden musical put up by College of Alice and Peter Tan, NUS in 2014. An avid fan of Japanese culture and language, I challenged myself to become proficient and passed the N2 level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test in 2012. My other hobbies include travelling and writing short stories.

Through my varied interests in both the sciences and arts, I look forward to sharing with Eunoians that they are not mutually exclusive but serve to fortify each other. I also hope to impart the transferable skills that can be learnt through interdisciplinary learning.
