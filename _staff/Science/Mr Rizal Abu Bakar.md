I graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering from the National University of Singapore and a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Secondary) from the National Institute of Education, specialising in Mathematics and Physics.

Upon completion, I taught Physics in several schools and junior colleges with varied profiles. Through this, besides preparing my students for the GCE A-Levels, I had the opportunity to mentor a few students in their research projects.

I enjoy the process of facilitating my students’ process of making sense of the concepts in the subject and gradually taking ownership of their learning. Most importantly, however, I believe that beyond the pursuit and possible achievement of excellent grades, the ability to make meaningful connections between knowledge and its impact on the world around us is of importance, in so appreciating the purpose of our existence.

Outside of teaching, I enjoy reading in a variety of areas. Other than that, I enjoy different sports, both as a spectator as well as a participant.

I hope to continue contributing to the overall development of my students and enabling them to grow and constantly inculcate positive values.
