I graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science (Second Upper Honours) in Applied Chemistry (Drug Option) and a minor in Forensic Science in 2013 from the National University of Singapore (NUS). I continued my graduate studies at NUS, completing a Master of Science in Research (Chemistry) in 2015 under the NUS Research Scholarship. My research work was in the field of Chemical Biology, where I studied the lipid transport system in _Mycobacterium smegmatis_.

As part of the scholarship criteria, I was involved in teaching undergraduates as a teaching assistant in laboratory modules. Through this teaching opportunity, I developed an interest and joy in teaching. After graduating, I decided to pursue a teaching career. I started my journey as a contract teacher at a junior college for a year prior to my entry into the National Institute of Education, where I completed the Postgraduate Diploma in Education (JC).

In my teaching journey, I hope to ignite the scientific curiosity in my students. I believe that there is still much we can learn about the world around us. Therefore, as a teacher, I hope to bridge the link between real-world phenomena that students experience every day to what they learn in the science curriculum. Aside from science, I also hope to inspire my students in having the mettle to explore different passions in their lives with my own personal stories of self-exploration.

During my free time, I enjoy travelling with my significant other to explore the different food and cultures that other countries have to offer. Also, I am currently studying Japanese to fulfil a personal goal of better appreciating and understanding Japanese culture through the language.
