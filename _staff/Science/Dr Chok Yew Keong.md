I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) in 2000 from the National University of Singapore. For being the top honours student in Chemistry, I was awarded the Singapore National Institute of Chemistry (SNIC) Gold Medal. I also received the Lijien Industrial Development Medal for the best Honours project. I completed my Master of Science under the Accelerated Master’s Programme in 2001. In 2009, I pursued my Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at the Nanyang Technological University, on the Ministry of Education (MOE) Postgraduate Scholarship.

I started teaching A-level Chemistry in 2003 and subsequently took on the role of Subject Head (Information Management) in 2006. Prior to joining Eunoia Junior College, I served as a Curriculum Planning Officer, and was heavily involved in the review of the A-level Chemistry curriculum.

I strongly believe that a school should not just equip students with academic knowledge in today’s context, where information is readily available. Rather, students should pick up both hard and soft skills that will see them through life. I see science, far from being a collection of facts, as an enduring discipline from which students can gain perseverance, a sense of wonder and other life skills. Now that I am in Eunoia Junior College, I am eager to see through the implementation of the revised curriculum, and to design a forward-looking Science education programme that will help our students develop invaluable 21st-century competencies.
