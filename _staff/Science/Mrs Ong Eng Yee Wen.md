I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Civil Engineering (Honours) in 2002. After 3 years at the Defence Science and Technology Agency, I joined the Ministry of Education and graduated from the National Institute of Education with a Postgraduate Diploma in Education in 2006.

Prior to joining Eunoia Junior College, I taught at another junior college for 15 years, where I had the privilege to work with teachers in various capacities – first as a Subject Head and later on a Head of Department. These valuable experiences have afforded me with vast opportunities to broaden my perspectives and to learn different teaching pedagogies from like-minded educators sharing a common passion.

My greatest hope for my students is that they would always approach their learning of Physics with a sense of wonderment, and for the subject to help them appreciate the world around them with a different lens and by extension, that they would approach life’s lessons in a similar way.

Outside of teaching, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors, whether locally or overseas. Hiking and cycling with my family have provided me with a sense of groundedness while affording quality bonding time with my loved ones.
