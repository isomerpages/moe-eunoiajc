<p>I majored in Chemical Engineering with a specialisation in pharmaceutical
engineering and a minor in Law at the National University of Singapore.
After spending a few years in a pharmaceutical company where I got opportunities
to mentor&nbsp;polytechnic students on their industrial attachment, I realised
I had developed an interest in working with young people.</p>
<p>My passion for Chemistry started when I was a junior college student.
I enjoyed the weekly practical sessions thoroughly and was intrigued by
the various concoctions I could create from mixing chemicals while making
deductions of the various reactions that have occurred based on the observations
I made. Despite this passion for Chemistry, I did not do well then. With
much perseverance and help from my friends, I manage to excel. From this
experience, I can personally understand the struggles of an academically
weak student.</p>
<p>My teaching journey began in 2006 and since then, I have taught at two
junior colleges as well as the JC section of an integrated programme school.
My students came from diverse backgrounds which motivated me to develop
different ways to engage them and monitor their learning. In the academic
area, I believe in empowering the students with the use of appropriate
instructional packages that cater to their different learning needs. My
varied experiences in mainly sports co-curricular activities reinforced
my conviction in not only providing our students with the skillsets to
meet future challenges but also to ground our students with the right set
of values to guide them through difficult times.</p>
<p>My greatest hope for my students is that they will always&nbsp;retain
a sense of curiosity, so they will not be afraid of asking questions and
have the courage to embrace new experiences with an open mind. &nbsp;

to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and
without fear for newer and richer experience”.&nbsp; I am excited to be
part of a like-minded team of educators preparing our Eunoians for the
challenges of the future.</p>
