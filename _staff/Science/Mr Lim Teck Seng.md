<p>I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor
of Engineering in 2003. The following year, I graduated from the National
Institute of Education with a Postgraduate Diploma in Education.</p>
<p>In my 16 years of teaching, I have taught at a junior college as well
as in a school offering the Integrated Programme. In all the Co-Curricular
Activities that I have been overseen, including Guitar Club, Studentsâ€™
Council, Science Society, Symphonic Band and Golf Club, I am most happy
to see my students developing leadership and organisational skills, and
most importantly, a heart to share and contribute to society.</p>
<p>In 2012, I conducted a sharing session at the East Zone Centre of Excellence
for Teaching and Learning on Individualised Assessment Report for H2 Physics.
In 2013, I presented at IPSG Sharing session for A-Level Physics Educators.
These are some of the highlights in terms of sharing best practices with
fellow Physics teachers.</p>
<p>I hope to continue to instil passion in the learning of Physics. Some
of the approaches include using real-life demonstrations to illustrate
the application of Physics in our everyday life. I look forward to a fruitful
stint at Eunoia Junior College where learning is made an enjoyable experience
for all students.</p>
