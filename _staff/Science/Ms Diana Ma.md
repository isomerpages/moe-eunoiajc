I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science with Honours (Second Upper) in Chemistry, where I worked on the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Having a strong interest in working with young people and sharing my passion for Chemistry, I pursued a Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education.

My teaching practice began in a junior college where I taught both Higher 2 and Higher 3 Chemistry. My students came from diverse backgrounds which motivated me to develop different ways to engage them and to monitor their learning. I also served as the coordinator of the Chemistry team, leading my colleagues in designing instructional packages to cater to the learning needs of our students. Following this, I was seconded to the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board where I worked in the review and implementation of examination syllabi at various levels of education. These experiences have given me better insights into how curriculum and assessment design support student learning.

I believe strongly in assessment for learning that provides students with useful and timely feedback on their progress towards mastery. I also desire to develop my students to become self-directed, reflective and resilient learners who take ownership and persevere in their learning. As a person who enjoys travelling and new experiences, I hope to instil in my students a sense of wonder and the joy of learning. I am excited to be part of a like-minded team of educators preparing our Eunoians for the challenges of the future.
