I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) in 2007 from National University of Singapore, after which I pursued my Doctor of Philosophy in Theoretical Physics under the Merlion Programme, a collaborative research program between Singapore and France. I was awarded the NUS Graduate Scholarship (later transferred to Centre for Quantum Technologies Scholarship) for my PhD studies.

I started teaching A-Level Physics in 2016. I have also been a trainer for the International Physics Olympiad Team of Singapore since 2020.

I strongly believe that learning physics should be a fun and rewarding process, in which students develop their skills in both imagination/visualisation and abstract mathematical reasoning. These highly valuable skills will serve them well in their future careers.
