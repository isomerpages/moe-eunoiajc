<p>I graduated from the National University of Singapore in 1989 with a Bachelor
of Science (Honours) in Physics, on a Public Service Commission (PSC) Local
Merit (Teaching) Scholarship. After obtaining my Diploma in Education from
the then Institute of Education in 1990, I was posted to a junior college
in the east where I started my teaching career as a Physics teacher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the years, I have had the good fortune to teach in various junior
colleges, and have worked with many passionate and talented colleagues.
Each of these postings has enriched me tremendously and helped shape my
values and beliefs as a teacher. Beyond the classroom, I have had experience
in different co-curricular activities, ranging from the sports, like Squash,
to the service-based, like Leo Club. Though not always enjoyable, sometimes
challenging, but they were certainly never boring.</p>
<p>I have also been given the opportunity to lead various teams of Physics
teachers at the different schools that I have been posted to, in the capacity
of a Level / Subject Coordinator. The experience is humbling, for it is
never easy to lead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the sparkle in my students’ eyes when they can finally appreciate
the beauty of a Physics concept is my goal in the classroom, but I have
also always believed that acquisition of content knowledge is secondary
to learning to be responsible, to be grateful, to be respectful, and to
be compassionate. These are values I hope to impart to all my students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am privileged to be able to participate in the writing of Eunoia’s narrative
as she grows. I look forward to many adventures ahead.</p>
