I graduated from the Nanyang University in Singapore with a Bachelor of Science in Physics.  After I completed my National Service, I started teaching in a secondary school while I went through training as a teacher with the Institute of Education in Singapore.  After graduating from the Institute of Education with a Graduate Diploma in Education, I started teaching Physics in a junior college.  During my work with the junior college, I was seconded to the Singapore Science Centre to work on a computer graphics project.  Upon completing my secondment to the Singapore Science Centre, I left the teaching service and started a computer software company with funds from some investors. While working at this company, I developed software for accounting and office administration.

I left the software company after more than a year and joined the Japan-Singapore Institute of Software Technology to conduct courses on computer software technology for pre-university graduates for 15 years. 

I then moved on to become a freelance computerisation consultant.  During my ten-year consultancy work, I travelled to China and various countries in Southeast Asia to train computer professionals on computer system design, computer network design, and computer software project management. I also had stints of tutoring at the National Institute of Education in Singapore.

During the 15-year work with Japan-Singapore Institute of Software Technology, I was sent to Tokyo and Okinawa for training in computer software systems and network design.  I also obtained a scholarship to complete a Master of Science in Computing course in Bradford University in the UK. 

In recent years, I have taught Physics in various junior colleges and in the integrated programme.  I believe that a teacher is a facilitator of learning. The student plays an important role in his own learning by being proactive and asking questions, taking responsibility for his own learning.  Solving Physics questions and problems is interesting as it helps us to understand the theory at a greater depth. This understanding will enable the students to apply the theories and solve future physics problems on their own.
