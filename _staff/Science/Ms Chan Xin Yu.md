<p>I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor
of Science (Second Upper Honours) in Chemistry. Prior to pursuing the Postgraduate
Diploma in Education (PGDE) at the National Institute of Education, I was
posted to the junior college section of an Integrated Programme school
for a four-week attachment and subsequently posted to a Pre-University
institute after completing my PGDE.</p>
<p>In my previous teaching stint, the students came from diverse backgrounds.
Given that the students were made up of mostly kinaesthetic and visual
learners, I was privileged to have learnt and explored teaching pedagogies
from experienced colleagues to engage the students and enhance their learning.
Being part of the working teams in student development, I also worked closely
with students through several student-led and student-focused programmes.
These include guiding student leaders to organise Level Bonding Camp and
Class Learning Day as well as structured mentoring of the repeat students.
It is always heartening to see how plans come to fruition and most importantly
the development of the students during the process as they grow to become
well-rounded individuals.</p>
<p>My teaching philosophy is to intrigue bright minds, empower the motivated,
and motivate the discouraged. Through conversations, I have learnt from
the students about the challenges and adversities they faced in their daily
life and how they overcame them. I strongly believe that every individual
has their own strengths; for some, it takes more time to discover. I hope
that I am able to create a safe environment for students to learn and explore
their interests without the fear of failure as learning from failure can
be the key to their success eventually.</p>
