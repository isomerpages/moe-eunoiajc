I graduated with a Bachelor of Science with Honours (Distinction) in Chemistry from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in June 2017. Upon my graduation, I followed my interest in teaching and completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE).

Prior to joining the Eunoia family, I was given the opportunity to teach in secondary schools. I gained valuable insights from my interactions with colleagues and students while teaching Lower Secondary Science and Chemistry at O-Level. I was also involved in the Student Leadership Committee to nurture student leaders.

To me, it is a great privilege to able to interact with youths and journey with them in their development. A quote by Parker Palmer resonated deeply with me. He says: “Good teaching cannot be reduced to techniques; good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher”. It is my belief to be an authentic and reflective practitioner who continually seeks to improve my teaching.

Additionally, I hope to support the innate sense of wonder and curiosity in students where they will be driven to explore and discover new things, including those beyond the scope of the syllabus. I will continue to share and impart relevant and transferable values and skills to my students and experience the joy of learning together with them.

In my free time, I like to read, make figurines out of mini building blocks and play the guitar.
