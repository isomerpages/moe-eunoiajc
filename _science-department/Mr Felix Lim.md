I graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor in Mechanical and Production Engineering with Honours, awarded by Nanyang Technological University. I spent the next two years working as an engineer for the Ministry of Environment. In 1996, I pursued my interest in Operation Research at the National University of Singapore under the full-time Master of Science (Industrial and System Engineering) Programme, after which I attained the Postgraduate Diploma in Education awarded by the National Institute of Education (NIE).

I started my teaching career in a secondary school for six months prior to my course in NIE.  After being trained as a Physics and Mathematics teacher, I was posted to a junior college in 2000 to teach Physics.  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to be involved in starting a cluster Science and Technological Center housed in the college.  Starting from 2007, I led the Physics teaching team as a coordinator to implement the teaching and learning programme so as to prepare the students for the A-level Examination.  Over the years, I am very proud to have brought many cohorts successfully through their ‘A’ Levels.  In 2010, I was appointed as a Senior Teacher.  I am very interested in making learning Physics interesting by creating and innovating hands-on devices and demonstrations. Under the category of innovation, our Physics team obtained three commendations  award under the MOE Innergy Award.  In 2015, the team was awarded the Gold Award under MOE Innergy Award. I have also spent 15 years of my teaching career in the Track & Field/ Cross Country Team as a teacher-in-charge.

I always believe that education is more than just giving knowledge and teaching the students how to solve content problems. Our role is to help them to make connections and meaning in what they are learning to the real world. We need to guide them to acquire skills so that they can grow, learn, and adapt to the fast changing world that they experience each day. I also believe that it is our role to mould their character so that they will good citizens, always ready to help the less able, and contribute to society.

After having many years of experience in leading a Physics Team, I am glad to have the opportunity to share my knowledge as well as to learn new skills from my colleagues.  I look forward to work with my new team members at Eunoia Junior College to bring the college to great heights not only in Physics but also in Track and Field if possible.

I love to run and I have completed seven marathons in the early part of my life. That explains my passion in Track and Field / Cross Country. I spend much of my free time with my family. I love to read and recently I have started to take an interest in Photography.
