<p>Across her various roles in Orientation, the National School Games (Basketball)
and the Student Council, Alyaa Aris led by example in her dedication. She
looks back on her journey of discovering herself, embracing imperfections
and uncovering the strength to take on new opportunities and challenges:</p>
<p>“Personally, I will always cherish memories from the NSG season. Undoubtedly,
it was one of the busiest times for me, filled with relentless basketball
games and match support carried out by the Student Council, but it was
also one of the most fulfilling times of my life. All the intense basketball
training sessions had led me and my teammates to those crucial moments
in the matches. The camaraderie we had established on and off court fueled
our mutual trust and desire to give our blood, sweat and tears (literally!)
on the court. I still remember having to rush from my NSG matches to other
Eunoian NSG matches to carry out match support as a Student Councillor;
screaming my lungs out when leading the student body in cheers as we persistently
encouraged our players regardless of a win or a loss. I might have left
that season with a few wounds and a bad sore throat, but nonetheless, I
gained unforgettable memories that will stay with me for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Nearing our A Levels, when tensions and stress levels were high, I found
comfort in the knowledge that my batchmates and I were all navigating the
same challenging journey of A Levels, facing the same late-night study
sessions and stressful exams. In the midst of it all, it was encouraging
to know that I wasn’t alone. Through shared struggles and support, we found
strength in each other, making the experience a little more bearable.</p>
<p>I have been very guarded by nature, and I always felt a need to put up
a certain front to others. However, my time in EJC allowed me to open up
and embrace vulnerability through the meaningful connections fostered with
my friends and teachers. Having had to juggle multiple commitments, be
it Basketball, Student Council, academics or my time as an OGL (Orientation
Group Leader), I wanted to prove that I could pull a “Wonderwoman” and
execute these roles independently, even though I found it exhausting. It
was with the support of my family, teachers and the friends I’ve made in
EJC that I was able to let down my walls and talk about the uncomfortable.
From bawling my eyes out in front of my classmates on the last day of school,
having deep talks, to having an embarrassing moment in front of my friends
and being able to laugh it off, all these moments&nbsp; showed me that
I could unapologetically be my raw and imperfect self. So thank you EJC,
for showing me that it is okay to not be okay sometimes.”</p>
