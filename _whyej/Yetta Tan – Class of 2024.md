<p>A dedicated and talented student in the Music Elective Programme (MEP)
and author of award-winning pieces in competitions such as the Xin Kong
Xia (新空下) National Schools Xinyao Festival 2023 (Open Category), and the
National Secondary Schools Chinese Mini Fiction Creative Writing Competition
2024, Yetta Tan inspires with the passion and purpose she devotes to her
various pursuits. She reveals the sources of motivation and strength behind
her endeavours as she makes her JC life a fulfilling one:</p>

<p>“I used to view JC as nothing more than two years of rigorous “academic
grinding”. However, stepping into EJ immediately changed my perspective.
Just from the very first moments in Orientation, I was captivated by the
school's vibrant culture and welcoming atmosphere that far exceeded my
expectations. Over the past two years, I was exposed to many opportunities
I never imagined, and blessed with an amazing environment that added meaning
and enjoyment to every learning experience along the way. I had friends
who stood by me through every hardship, finding joy and laughing at the
most mundane and simplest moments, celebrating both our shared and individual
achievements. With the space and support from my friends and teachers to
explore and deepen my interests such as music and writing, I slowly gained
the confidence and encouragement to step out of my comfort zone more often,
showcasing myself and my work beyond the classroom walls. In EJ, I found
purpose, open-minded and inspiring people, and found myself genuinely looking
forward to lessons, CCA, and every moment and aspect that shaped my fulfilling
EJC journey, a journey I will never regret embarking on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The strong sense of belonging I experienced in EJ is a feeling that has
stayed with me. Before EJ, I never believed school could feel like a second
home. As someone with a unique timetable and part of a CG (23-A1) with
a diverse range of subject combinations, I was initially unsure if I would
find my place. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised to look forward to every
tutorial, each with different groups of friends who made even the toughest
content of the syllabus or projects more bearable. Despite most of us sharing
only one or two subjects, there was always something that connected us—
our “love” for homework such as essays, common games, struggles, a shared
goal, the different parts of the school we experienced, or simply the jokes
from lectures or other activities. Surrounded by such an amazing, humorous
and supportive community, there was never a dull day in EJ, and I never
once felt alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My JC journey is definitely not a solitary one. I would like to thank
my parents for their unwavering support in every way possible—going out
of their way to drive me to and from school on early mornings and late
nights, attending all my performances no matter the location, and making
countless sacrifices to allow me to fully embrace my JC life without any
worries. I also want to express my appreciation to my teachers, who have
guided me through this journey, recognised my passions, and gone the extra
mile to help me grow. Thank you for your dedication, for investing your
time and effort to engage us in every lesson/ programme, and for making
learning both meaningful and enjoyable. Your blood, sweat, and tears have
shaped us into better versions of ourselves, giving us a truly enriching
JC experience. Finally, to all my closest friends (in CG, MEP, Choir),
you guys are the highlight of my JC life. Thank you for all the amazing
memories, laughter and tears, and all the memorable moments that I will
cherish deeply for the rest of my life. It has also been an honour to meet
everyone I have crossed paths with in EJ. You guys made coming to EJ a
decision I will forever be grateful for.”</p>
