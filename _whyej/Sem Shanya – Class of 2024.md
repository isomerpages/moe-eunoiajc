<p>Sem Shanya (23-E1), captain of the Tennis Girls’ Team, is known for her
kindness, activism, and leadership. She inspires through her account of
her time spent at EJC.</p>
<p>“My journey in EJ has been nothing short of a roller coaster- filled with
exhilarating highs and moments that pushed me to grow. One thing for sure,
is that there was never a dull moment. I came in through JAE, and to be
honest, I was definitely intimidated at first. Stepping into a new environment
where many had already built their connections was daunting, but I soon,
and very quickly realized that EJ was a place where people truly welcomed
and supported one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I threw myself into school life, as the captain of the tennis girls' team
and a member of cross country, sports became a huge part of my life here.
Whether it was the intensity of training, the thrill of awaiting a competition
or simply the camaraderie of my teammates, these experiences shaped my
time in EJ. Beyond the courts and the track, it was the daily moments—late
night dinners with friends, laughing in the canteen, the small yet meaningful
interactions—that made this journey unforgettable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like any roller coaster, there were lows, feeling overwhelmed and stressed
were but a few of those challenges. But they only made the highs feel even
more rewarding. Now that this ride has come to an end, it’s bittersweet.
There’s a sense of exhilaration, knowing we’ve made it through, but also
the lingering feeling of wanting to chase that next high. EJ has given
me memories, friendships, and experiences that I’ll carry with me long
after this chapter closes, and for that, I’ll always be grateful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The everyday experiences. Little nods and waves across the auditorium,
being able to catch up through small talk in the canteen or running to
make it for a lecture.&nbsp; I’m sure many of my peers know this feeling
of comfort and familiarity that is accompanied by our daily life in school.
Now that we’ve graduated and are J3s, I find myself missing these everyday
experiences the most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be said that these experiences can be shared across any school,
however these moments in EJ are special. And that is due to the people
you can only find here. I may be biased, very clearly, but I truly believe
that the friendships and memories I've made here are unlike any other.
Our strong school and house culture that brings us together beyond just
academics have shaped so much of my life the past 2 years, from screaming
my heart out to songs to hysterical panic sessions leading up to A Levels.
Filled with so much laughter and support, I'll take away from EJ the deep
sense of belonging I felt constantly through my 2 years here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say the list of people I'm grateful to is endless.
From my family, closest friends, teachers, classmates. The sheer amount
of help, guidance and support I've received is overwhelming in the best
way possible. Likewise, my gratitude to each individual who positively
impacted my EJ journey is immeasurable. In particular, I’d like to specially
thank my life coach, who always reached out when times got stressful and
constantly offered sound and assuring advice which helped me keep my cool
throughout J2.”</p>
