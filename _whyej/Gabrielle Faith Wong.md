Besides the many subjects and leadership positions offered, EJ has a wide variety of unique programmes and opportunities for Eunoians. I have been involved in Latitude, Altitude, Magnitude and signed up to be a Student Ambassador and part of the Orientation EXCO. These experiences allow me to explore my passions, interact and forge friendships with other students with similar interests and create many core memories! I believe the numerous avenues for personal development make Eunoia more than a school â€” EJ has become a nurturing home for me and my friends.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Gabrielle Faith Wong Hui En (23-O3)</strong></p>
