<p>Tan Shih Han (23-O3), President of EJC Dance, redefined leadership by
blending authenticity with inclusivity; making everyone feel seen, heard,
and valued. She united people, fostering a positive culture where everyone
thrived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My time in EJC has been defined by the incredible people who have surrounded
me and shaped my journey into one that is both fulfilling and hectic in
the best way possible. As I worked on House events with the Ora House Committee
and led Dance throughout the year, I’ve had the privilege of meeting so
many people who have made Eunoia feel like home. Even with the constant
presence of A Levels looming over us, the past two years have been filled
with invaluable opportunities and lessons. The friendships forged, the
unwavering support from teachers, and the shared experiences of both struggles
and successes have made this journey all the more memorable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the highlights from my time in EJC would have to be seeing Concert
Enchanté come to life. As the first-ever collaborative concert between
Dance and Street Dance, there was a constant sense of excitement and pressure
to live up to expectations. Yet, it was an incredibly rewarding journey,
thanks to the unwavering support and encouragement from the EJD family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reminiscing on our late-night practices, the collective shouts of <em>"</em>Jiayou",
and the way we huddled together for our cheer after every school event
made me cherish those moments even more. Taking our final bows was a bittersweet
goodbye, but knowing we had done it together made it all the more meaningful.
Working alongside our teachers-in-charge and alumni to craft performance
pieces was equally heartwarming and the sense of camaraderie and fulfillment
is something I’ll carry with me long after Eunoia.</p>
<p>From the friends I meet in the canteen every morning to study, to the
uncles I’ve befriended after countless nights of being “chased out” of
the Performing Arts Studios, every interaction has shaped my experience
for the better. To everyone I have crossed paths with — friends, teachers,
and more — thank you for making Eunoia feel like home.”</p>
