<p>Renee Lim (23-U1) was a Humanities Scholar, a student councillor who always
stepped up to serve and helmed publicity efforts for OH EUNOIA!, and a
an avid photographer for @ejcmedia. Most importantly, Renee was a beacon
to her peers and stood tall amidst setbacks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My first two years in EJ were iconic and so, so colourful. EJ gave me
countless opportunities to discover myself, make mistakes in a somewhat
sheltered environment, and to be bold. I worked hard, and played even harder,
making lifelong memories and friends along the way. It was a fever dream.</p>
<p>When I was struck with a health ordeal in 2023 in my graduating year,
I was forced to defer my A-Levels to 2024. Devastating as it was to an
18-year-old, it was a challenge I had to work through. I never thought
that I was strong nor resilient, as I knew there was no way around it,
only a way <em>through</em> it. Even in the onslaught of disease, I remember
a junior once told me he admired how I could be so positive while going
through something so trying. It was then that I made a decision to be purposefully
happy every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most defining moment in my EJ journey was my graduation with the Class
of 2023. At that point, I knew I was only graduating with my friends in
name. And so I cried, possibly harder than anyone else, because of how
much my illness had taken from me, and how that ceremony represented a
sense of loss. The tears were bittersweet but happy nonetheless. Seeing
my batchmates for the last time, I felt a sense of comfort and peace, because
I knew that even if I had to face the gruelling J2 year all over again,
I already had an amazing one to look back on, one I could not ask more
of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is followed by my second graduation a year later, free of the chains
that held me down, with the Class of 2024. There were tears once again,
but now of pure gratitude and relief. When I looked at the faces of my
new friends, I felt triumphant and blessed this time.</p>
<p>I am extremely grateful that I had strong systems of support in EJ, school
leaders who accommodated my new needs, teachers who cared about my recovery
and friends who stood by me. They have taught me that you are stronger
than you think. This last year in EJ was vastly different from the previous
two years I experienced, and a far cry away from what I expected of a typical
JC journey. But what remained constant, and even became more apparent,
was that EJ was a place I could always come home to.”</p>
