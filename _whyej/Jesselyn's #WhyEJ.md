EJ is the place where I've found my community. It's not rare for me to meet a stranger, spontaneously start talking and then become friends! Be it my CCA, OG, CG or various friends I've met through events or mutuals, EJ has many of my closest friends who make me feel very supported. The teachers are also very supportive and have always lent me a listening ear when I need them! Going to school is always something I look forward to because of the wonderful people. ðŸ¥°</p></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Jesselyn Chenice (23-I3)</strong></p>
