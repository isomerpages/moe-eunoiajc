<p>Wanting to give my all, I pushed myself too hard at EuRun in 2023 and
was hospitalised for heat exhaustion and compartment syndrome. As a result,
I was absent for an entire term while undergoing three operations and physiotherapy.
Missing lessons and my friends was stressful and losing my muscular strength
made me doubt myself. At times I felt like I let down my CCA as the only
DSA Dance student, but I learned to focus on recovering my physical and
mental health, and on staying positive for the remainder of JC1.

<p>Working on our performance for the 2024 Chinese New Year celebrations
in JC2 was a key point on my journey. Certain moves which placed pressure
on my right shin still posed a great challenge. Our dance instructor’s
constant encouragement and my CCA mates’ assurance kept me going. I knew
I could persevere, with the opportunity to enjoy dancing with them and
to overcome my difficulties for them. My friends, family and teachers were
a pillar of support to whom I will always be grateful for, knowing that
they are by my side.</p>

<p>Looking back at my 2 years in EJ, I cherish every single moment, both
the highs and the lows. I came to view any unfortunate circumstance as
a learning point and motivation to move forward, rather than be dragged
down. I learned the importance of a positive support system and how I can
work on myself, to find light in the darkness.</p>
