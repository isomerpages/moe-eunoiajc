<p>A compassionate leader dedicated to service and holistic excellence, Glenda
Sui has made a lasting impact as the President of EJ Heal Hearts and Class
Vice-Chairperson. From leading her team to organise a fundraising concert
and volunteer activities for cancer patients to fostering a strong sense
of camaraderie within her class, she has exemplified care, resilience,
and unwavering dedication. Reflecting on her time in Eunoia Junior College,
she shares how the challenges she faced, the friendships she built, and
the spirit of service she embraced have shaped her into the person she
is today:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Looking back at my time in Eunoia Junior College, I can sincerely say
that it was nothing short of an incredibly fulfilling journey. First and
foremost, I had the greatest privilege of meeting amazing friends and teachers,
who not only served as inspiring role models, but also supported me through
the countless challenges I faced. The connections I have made over the
past two years have truly been the most rewarding part of my experience
at Eunoia.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the journey was not without its difficulties. As various
academic and extracurricular demands piled on, juggling everything at once
became a challenge. Many times, I also questioned my abilities and whether
I was performing at my best. Yet, I ultimately found that these challenges
were some of my greatest opportunities for growth. Through them, I learnt
to embrace resilience, to find strength in moments of doubt, and to view
setbacks not as failures, but as powerful lessons. More importantly, I
also witnessed the strength and perseverance of those around me, who continuously
pushed through their own challenges with resilience and determination.
In the end, it wasn’t just my own growth, but the collective spirit of
everyone around me that has made this journey so fulfilling and inspiring.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My friends played a huge role in inspiring me with their relentless hard
work and dedication. Seeing their commitment to their studies and goals
pushed me to strive for my best, even when things felt overwhelming. They
were not only a source of inspiration but also a constant source of support.
Whether it was through late-night study sessions or simply offering encouragement
when I doubted myself, they were always there to help me through difficult
moments. As for my teachers, their dedication went beyond just teaching
the syllabus. They encouraged me to question, explore, and develop my own
perspectives. Such guidance helped me grow, not just as a student but as
a thinker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond academics, I found great purpose in helping the less fortunate
in our community. Through initiatives such as GLIDE, I had the opportunity
to connect with individuals facing significant hardships. It became clear
to me that true service isn’t just about giving material support, but about
offering compassion, dignity, and hope. Working alongside those in need,
I saw how even small acts of kindness could bring moments of relief and
joy to others. These experiences taught me how much of an impact we can
have by simply showing up for those who need it most. In helping others,
I found a sense of fulfillment that reminded me of the power of service
to transform lives.”</p>
