<p>Rei Ho (23-I2) served her class as a peer support leader whose care and
compassion for her classmates was crystal clear to all, be it in her daily
interactions or the thoughtful activities she organised for them. Moreover,
Rei showed remarkable resilience as she navigated a health setback in the
family, spending as much time with her family while balancing the rigorous
demands of her JC2 year. Unfazed and selfless, Rei truly was exemplary.</p>
<p>“I’ve always believed that we are all fabrics of the bits and pieces that
we pick up from the people we cross paths with throughout our lives, and
I owe a big part of who I am today to the people whom I love and the ones
who love me with all that they have. My biggest source of inspiration and
one of my strongest pillars is undeniably my father who never fails to
tell me how proud he is of me and that he is always cheering me on. Through
his support and unwavering faith in me over the years, I have been able
to build myself up safely and securely, and grow at my own pace. I carry
with me the lessons he taught me, and more importantly a deep love for
life he inspired in me. My mother, who has taught me all about womanhood
and the resilience of life, as well as my brother who drops everything
to play with me, hang out and have conversations about life, school, and
everything in between, have been nothing but loving and supportive of me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also eternally grateful for my best friends who are unconditionally
there for me – they are the people who would stay up all night with me
to talk about life, and who never fail to give me a warm hug when I need
it, and when I don’t. To the girls who have seen me through literally everything
and never fail to remind me that they are always here for me, Yu Xin, Chern
Yee, Taria, Kayla, Rianne and Clarisse, I hope you know that it has been,
and always will be such an honour to be laughing and growing alongside
you. My teachers, who have given me boundless grace, empathy, understanding,
love and support, as well as all the people whom I have crossed paths with
in the past 18 years, have all made a genuine difference in my life and
have taught me all I need to know about love and navigating life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feeling of home that would not have been possible without 23-I2. I
have truly met the kindest, sweetest souls, my friends and teachers, in
this class. Over the two tiring JC years, we bonded over how difficult
the syllabus is, how many tutorials and lectures we have yet to complete,
and then back to how hard the syllabus is. But it is also within the two
years that we built small, everyday moments of bonding and support that
made this journey so worthwhile. From “Chope-ing” entire rows of seats
in the canteen just so we could sit together as a class for lunch every
day to celebrating each other’s birthdays together (and teachers giving
us 5 minutes of time in class to do so!). It is a great honour to have
been the Peer Support Leader alongside one of my closest friends Kayla,
and seeing every member supporting each other. Their genuine compassion
for each other has made a culture of care, and I am honoured to have found
a home in my civics group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I think about my two years in EJ, I think about growing up. JC has
been a process of putting yourself in difficult situations and finding
ways to overcome them, a process of pushing your limits while also accepting
and reaffirming your boundaries, and a process of reaching your goals together
with a whole school – whether close, mutuals or strangers you have probably
brushed shoulders with a thousand times in the canteen. It is in these
uncomfortable moments that you find within yourself the tremendous potential
for growth, and come to recognise that you are not alone in the process
of growing up.”</p>
