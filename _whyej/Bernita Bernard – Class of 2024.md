<p>A vibrant and dedicated member of the EJC community, Bernita has embodied
integrity, love, service, and courage in all that she does. Whether championing
Indian culture during Racial Harmony Day, rallying support for the Mediacorp
Tamil Debate finals, or stepping up as a calm and composed stage manager
for Lit Fest, she has been a source of positivity and inspiration to her
peers. Beyond these defining moments, she cherishes the everyday friendships
and lessons that have shaped her journey. As she reflects on her time in
Eunoia Junior College, she shares how taking chances, embracing resilience,
and leaning on the support of her community have made these two years truly
unforgettable:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My time at EJ can only be described as unforgettable. In the past two
years, I have been moulded by incredible people and friends that I hold
so near and dear. Coming to EJ I felt determined to make my last official
2 years in school memorable - and so I did. Everything from LitFest to
trying to share my Indian culture with EJ in various ways have all allowed
me to learn something valuable. From running frantically across the stage
during a time crunch with stagehands, for Litfest I learnt the importance
of effective&nbsp; teamwork. Doing - backbreaking- rangoli on the floor
with my friends and planning for RHD until the sunset, I learnt about pursuits
led by passion and determination. These were truly the times I felt the
indelible spirit of EJ.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If EJ has taught me anything, it is to take chances. Seizing opportunities
no matter how scared or worried you are. I learnt that even if I fail,
there’s always something else right around the corner- a new opportunity.&nbsp;
Not letting my fear, doubts and judgments hold me back was the biggest
gift I could have ever given myself in EJ.&nbsp; Be it taking that leap
of faith to make a new friend or trying out for something I thought I'd
never get, EJ&nbsp; was where I&nbsp; renewed my spirit of adventure and
resilience. This is what allowed me to experience the incredible events,
and camaraderie&nbsp; that ej has so graciously blessed me with! Learning
to deal with the disappointments of my failures was a learning curve. Trying
to understand that one terrible moment does not define my worth or reflect
my journey in EJ was difficult. But with the support of my classmates and
friends in my moments of upset have been a precious gift.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overall my time here has allowed me to expand my vision. So ultimately
I’ve learnt that when in doubt take that chance, what could go wrong?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I truly believe I would have never survived the hectic two years without
the support from my extraordinary friends and teachers! Every comforting
hug during my ugly crying sessions to quick squeezes on my hand during
difficult lessons have made all the difference for me. I am immensely grateful
to Mdm Ela for always having my back, my math teachers for never once giving
up on me, my CT Ms Renuka for making all the difference by supporting me
throughout my time here in EJ and every teacher that has taught me with
such dedication- thank you!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But most importantly, to my parents for absolutely everything. Whose love
for me I have witnessed through their cheers and constant motivation have
served as my source of strength through it all. My gratitude has to be
conveyed also to my friends from secondary school who have stuck by me
these two crazy years, lending me their shoulders to share my burdens-
I couldn’t have done it without them!”
