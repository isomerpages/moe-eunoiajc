<p>Phoebe Raelyn Quek (23-O6) has been dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge
beyond the syllabus, participating in several research projects such as
at MIT’s Research Science Institute and Tufts Medical Centre, as well as
STEM programmes. She has also achieved outstanding results.</p>
<p>“Big things have humble beginnings, just like how some of the most defining
moments of EJC weren’t loud, significant events, but simple joys in everyday
life that wove us together and got us through the most stressful times.
I remember sharing jokes between lessons at TR7-03, racing to the canteen
to beat the “cai fan” lunch queue and Tuesday morning conversations at
the cafe. Over the years, these little moments synthesized into great bonds
of friendship. It is comforting to have the freedom to dream without fear
and to take leaps knowing that if I were to fall, there would be hands
reaching out to pull me back up, just as I would do the same for them.
That, more than anything, is what I hope to carry with me - the certainty
that no hurdle is too high because we have each other.</p>
<p>Beyond our classroom grades were the unexpected memories I collected as
I ventured beyond the trodden path and explored a world of opportunities
- getting sprayed by elephants at our EunoiaGO trip to Chiang Mai; the
cheerful smiles of the Thai children we taught; conducting genetics experiments
at the Tufts Medical Center lab overlooking the Boston skyline; watching
sunrises with friends after all-nighters poring over piles of research
papers. clearing 3 dumpsters worth of hoarded items from a flat at a Habitat
for Humanity HomeWorks session, organised by the GLIDE project I led; a
mad rush making hundreds of keychains with my team for our fundraising
sale; my continuing service with YMCA Youth For Causes that is close to
my heart, supporting Singapore youths meaningfully in social entrepreneurship
and building their community leadership skills. and the rambunctious nerf
war to end our Computing and Robotics Club CCA odyssey with a bang. Topping
it all off were the diverse and phenomenal people I encountered and the
connections that we built, as they continue to support and inspire me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In JC, we’re bombarded with many questions we aren’t sure how to answer.
Not only in our exam practices, but also in questions about our plans for
university or the legacy we want to leave in our community as we move into
the next stage of our lives. My time in EJC equipped me with answers to
those questions, lessons on resilience, courage to embrace the unknown,
and the realization that the best moments happen when we go out there and
chase our dreams. For that, I will always be grateful.</p>
