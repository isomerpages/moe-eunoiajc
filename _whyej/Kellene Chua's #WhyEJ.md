Taking part in the collegeâ€™s many activities have given me a sense of house and college pride, especially when our house stood on stage together in our purple house shirts and our cheers echoed in unison throughout the hall. The vibrant house culture is definitely something that makes up the Eunoia experience, which makes me part of a strongly bonded community and family.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kellene Chua (23-U6)</strong></p><p></p>
