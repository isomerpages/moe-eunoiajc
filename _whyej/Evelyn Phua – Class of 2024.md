<p>A disciplined and passionate advocate for the environment, Evelyn has
demonstrated unwavering commitment to sustainability throughout her time
in Eunoia Junior College. From personally collecting and sorting recyclables
to ensuring more effective waste management on campus, she has led by example,
proving that small, consistent efforts can contribute to meaningful change.
As she embarks on a new journey as a naval officer, she reflects on the
challenges she has faced, the lessons she has learned, and the values that
continue to drive her forward:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Initially, like many JAE students, I was very worried; integrating into
a JC with three feeder schools, coping (ie. doing well) with new subjects
and trying to build a strong portfolio. Despite my hopes, many of those
things had not gone as planned and I hadn’t involved myself in many other
activities either. Although, in spite of my struggles, I learnt to put
my heart into other issues like the environment. During my two years, I
have collected waste papers, primarily&nbsp; cardboard from around school
as well as the bookshop (occasionally plastic bottles), to recycle at material-specific
bins. While EJ does have blue bins and recycling bins on campus, blue bins
are mostly for general recyclables and the recycling bins were treated
more like trash bins containing rubbish which contaminates the recyclables.
Thus they tend to not be properly utilised hence I opted for more intentional
recycling. Personally, this ‘project’ was more of a habit because I believed
it is meaningful to put in just a bit more effort to ensure recycling becomes
a slightly more effective process in environmental protection. While the
effort relative to the problem was small, and I still got odd stares every
now and then, it was a simple matter of it being better than nothing and
hoping that these small efforts would accumulate and someday effect some
degree of improvement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would like to thank the teachers and non teaching staff for their unwavering
support for my ‘project’. From contributing to my efforts, providing me
with trolleys, allocating space to act as my recycling point and believing
in my initiative, I am thankful for all the administrative support given
to me to make my processes much more efficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would also like to thank my classmates 23-U5 for being a source of comfort
amidst the struggles. Thank you for being a listening ear to my many concerns
and the much needed manpower to carry around all my recyclables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Besides the environment, another area that I feel strongly for is international
relations. That, together with the desire to protect the things I care
for had led me to enlist and pursue a career as a naval officer.”</p>
