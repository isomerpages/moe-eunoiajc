<p>Caleb Seow (23-U6) from Class of 2024 is a tenacious individual who exemplifies
the perfect balance of academic excellence and leadership. A dedicated
House Captain, Caleb approaches every challenge with resilience, humility,
with a deep commitment to doing what is right. His insightful curiosity
and generous spirit make him a true role model for his peers—proving that
success is not just about achievements, but about character and a willingness
to uplift others along the way:</p>
<p>“I lived 2 lives in EJ—a life of quiet consistency and discipline in my
academic endeavours, and a second of high-energy, extroversion, and innovation
as a councillor and House Captain of Uzuri. It was in this beautiful chaos
where I found my love for EJ. I have had the opportunity to experience
so many struggles (and find so much more joy) that have shaped my grit;
so many lessons that have triggered life-changing reflections and made
me a better person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While seemingly disparate, these 2 lives have pointed me in the same direction
- it has fostered my resolve to strive for the best, to think critically,
and most importantly, to learn from others, and from my mistakes. My life
in EJ was riddled with both joys and setbacks, and I relish every experience
I’ve had the privilege to enjoy.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, it is the people in EJ who have pushed me to constantly
aim for better. As Uzuri House Captain, I had the experience of working
with a huge and diverse range of personalities, each with their own quirks,
thought processes and motivations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, working with my 2 Vice-Captains, Kate and Natasha, was
a whole crazy experience in itself. With 3 distinct, stubborn personalities,
we definitely got off on an awkward and rocky start, and I remember clearly
struggling to find my place in our captains’ dynamic. As some of my closest
friends now, the influence of these 2 people on me today is evident and
undeniable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that, working with 12 other House Captains and 12 Housecomm
members has taught me so much. Despite us all working towards the same
aim, the categorically different ways in which we worked towards it inspired
me to think beyond my own normal thought processes. They encouraged me
to be more creative, to play on strengths, to consider niche interests,
and kept me humble and open to growth.</p>
<p>Lastly, my family was a guiding star for me, especially in times when
I felt stuck or lost, unable to overcome some disagreement or sudden challenge.
With sagely wisdom, they encouraged me to take a step back when I obsessed
over something, to focus on what’s truly important, and always reminded
me of their support and assurance.</p>
<p>I owe it to all these people, who have driven me to keep going even when
things went south, and who are the reason I do my best.”</p>
