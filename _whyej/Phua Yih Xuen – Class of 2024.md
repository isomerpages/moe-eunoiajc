<p>Phua Yi Xuen embodies both intellectual curiosity and heartfelt commitment
to creative excellence, as a young artist with a deep understanding of
and appreciation for art’s power to connect and inspire. Her story reminds
us of the beautiful and uplifting moments to be found in sincere interactions
with the people around us:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“If I had to sum up my EJ journey in one word, it would definitely be
“unforgettable.” Over my two years in EJ, I was fortunate to have such
a supportive and welcoming environment that encouraged me to step out of
my comfort zone and explore new experiences. These experiences, both the
highs and the lows, have shaped me into who I am today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My artistic journey at EJC, in particular, is something I am incredibly
grateful for. Choosing to take H2 Art and later H3 Art were decisions I
absolutely do not regret. Over time, art lessons became the highlight of
my week. From the late-night coursework grinds with my art friends to soaking
up every word during lessons, these seemingly small moments were like sprinkles
of sunshine in my EJ journey. The constant support and encouragement from
my two incredible art teachers will always hold a special place in my heart.
Their guidance helped spark and deepen my passion for art, preparing me
as I continue my artistic journey beyond the classroom walls</p>
<p></p>
<p>Though my two years at EJ flew by, the memories I made will remain close
to my heart for years to come. I will never forget my first experience
exhibiting a piece of art as part of the music and art collaboration. Seeing
friends, batchmates, and even strangers engage with something I helped
create was truly magical, a moment I will always treasure. Another moment
that touched me deeply was during one of our interactive art lessons, where
we had the opportunity to create art in Bishan Park. As we approached an
uncle to learn more about the space, I did not expect his willingness to
share his stories with us. Despite being mute, he enthusiastically communicated
with us&nbsp; through sketches and hand gestures. This small yet powerful
moment touched me deeply and&nbsp; reminded me of art’s capacity to communicate
and connect with different individuals without the need for words.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are so many people I want to thank for making my JC journey so warm
and meaningful. I am deeply grateful to everyone who supported, encouraged,
and lifted me up throughout these two years. I am especially thankful to
my family, who held my hand through tough times and supported me in all
my endeavors. To my friends and classmates: you brought so much life and
warmth to my days, whether it was a quick wave in the corridor, chatting
in the canteen, or study sessions together—those little moments always
brightened my days. I’m also incredibly grateful to all the teachers I
had the privilege of learning from, and I truly appreciate their guidance
and tireless support throughout my journey. A special thank you to my art
teachers, Ms Quek and Ms Low, for believing in me and creating a safe,
nurturing space that helped all of us bloom into our best selves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looking back, I realise just how much the people in my life have shaped
me. These two years were about so much more than studying, they were about
the people and memories that made the journey truly unforgettable.”&nbsp;</p>
