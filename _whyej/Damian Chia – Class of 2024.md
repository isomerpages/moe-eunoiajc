<p>A passionate and dedicated servant leader, Damian has inspired many through
his role as President of the Service Learning Club and IC of GLIDE. From
planning large-scale school events like Orientation 2024 and Graduation
Day to leading service initiatives such as Project Apoyo, he has embraced
every opportunity to step out of his comfort zone and uplift those around
him. Reflecting on his journey in Eunoia Junior College, Damian shares
how the collective passion of his peers, the guidance of his mentors, and
the challenges he has overcome have shaped his leadership and deepened
his commitment to service:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My 2 year journey in EJC has been nothing short of enriching. Through
electrifying moments like taking on the role of Logistics IC for Orientation
2024 and planning various other school events like Graduation Day, EJC
has provided me with a myriad of opportunities for me to step out of my
comfort zone and grow through the process of conquering challenges. Being
the President of the Service Learning Club has also taught me the importance
of rallying my team and inspiring them to go the extra mile to serve various
beneficiaries. My Eunoia journey has truly been a colourful kaleidoscope
of many diverse experiences that I will reminisce and treasure dearly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Seeing the passion blaze in the hearts of fellow Eunoians to serve and
give back to the community has fuelled my desire to lead others in service.
The active participation of my peers in events organised by my team in
Project Apoyo, such as tutoring students from underprivileged backgrounds,
has truly helped me&nbsp; find meaning in creating such opportunities to
empower other Eunoians to serve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would like to offer my deepest gratitude to my CCA teacher-in-charge,
Ms Ng Siow Ying, for always being such a nurturing mentor to me. Ms Ng
has guided me in honing my leadership skills through planning events like
Deep Dive Day 2 and being willing to engage in discussions with the team.
She truly listens, appreciates inputs from the group and provides us with
the platform, as well as the courage, to venture into uncharted depths
and take on projects that stretch us to become better versions of ourselves.
The values and skills she has imparted to me will certainly be held closely
to my heart and serve me well for years to come.”</p>
