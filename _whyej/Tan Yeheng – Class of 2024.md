<p>Tan Yeheng (23-I5) is deeply passionate about Physics, participating avidly
in the Singapore Physics Olympiad in 2023, taking up H3 Semiconductor Physics
in 2024, and inspiring others by helping his classmates in the subject.</p>
<p>“Facing some social anxiety, I was very nervous about entering EJC. Despite
being in the JIP batch, I knew very few people and was afraid I would not
be able to socialise and make new friends. I never expected to flourish
in EJC, but luckily, my fears were never realised. In this short time of
less than two years, I forged considerable friendships while bolstering
old ones, filling my life with memorable moments inside and outside of
school. From daily lunches with my classmates to post-CCA outings, I had
no shortage of companionship to keep me going, especially through some
tough times. Even as I pursued my academic interests in the form of Olympiads
and the external H3 semiconductors programme, I was continuously surrounded
by old and new friends, keeping my mind both intellectually stimulated
and socially engaged. Truly, to go fast is to go alone, but to go far is
to go together.</p>
<p>I am most thankful for everyone who was with me over these two years.
I enjoyed my time with my classmates, such as during Economics lessons,
where we dissected essay questions and drew diagrams, and at the canteen,
where we ate, chatted, and played foosball and pool. I also cherish my
time with old friends from secondary school, especially my oldest friend,
who never turned down any request for help, always accompanying me and
exchanging notes and answers. I will never forget my teachers, especially
my civic tutors, Ms Chan and Mr Chia, as well as Mr Chuah, our Economics
teacher, each of whom was exceptional in their craft and made classes both
engaging and enjoyable. Lastly, to my parents, for whom my gratitude cannot
be quantified, thank you for always being there for me—allowing me to make
my own choices and always supporting them — giving me guidance and advice
when I was too bogged down to continue. Each of these people has played
an invaluable role in shaping my journey through JC, enriching my experiences,
broadening my perspectives, and leaving a lasting impact on my growth.”</p>
