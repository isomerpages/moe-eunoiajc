<p>Arifin Zulkarnain (23-E3) was a dedicated captain of the boy’s Table Tennis
team. When faced with challenges, he adapted with tremendous discipline
and resilience, emerging a true role model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I would describe my EJC journey as truly enjoyable. Reflecting on my
experiences, I realized that despite the numerous stressful moments—such
as preparing for A-levels and gearing up for NSG—the supportive people
around me always lightened the load, making those times more bearable.
Whether it was embarking on spontaneous side quests during study sessions
or engaging in friendly competition during training, there were always
unforgettable memories that enriched my journey. The school events also
added excitement to my EJC experience, as the spirited house competition
fostered camaraderie and encouraged participation in events like the Inter-House
Games, allowing us to unwind and further strengthen our friendships. My
EJC journey is one that I will cherish and never regret.</p>
<p>One of my motivations during my NSG season was to help set a benchmark
for what could be achieved. Despite neither our boys' nor girls' team being
the strongest on paper, I wanted everyone to give our best effort to secure
a top-four finish, inspiring future batches to always strive for excellence
regardless of the circumstances. The added challenge of not being the favored
team made every struggle even more meaningful. While the boys' team did
not achieve our desired results, the girls' team made history by securing
second place, with a remarkable victory over one of the top schools. Although
my role in the girls' team’s success was minor, I am grateful to have been
part of a dedicated and passionate team that turned the impossible into
a reality.&nbsp; It was truly inspiring to watch them give their all despite
facing a top-seeded opponent. Even though I wasn't on the court, I could
feel their passion and fighting spirit—it was infectious, evinced by the
loud cheers from the players on the sidelines. That match is especially
meaningful to me because it exemplified true sportsmanship. Everyone showed
up, played their best albeit the odds, and their efforts ultimately paid
off with the victory.</p>
<p>I hope this achievement serves as a lasting inspiration for future batches
to dream big, break barriers, and continue raising the standard for generations
of sportsmen to come.”</p>
