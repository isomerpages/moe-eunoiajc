<p>Veritable powerhouse and all-rounder Sarah Tan (23-E4) found the time
to excel in STEM (winning the prestigious Engineering and Tech Scholarship),
serve as Eder House Vice-Captain, and represent the college in Badminton.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Coming in as a J1, I was met with a school culture unlike any other -
one that was vibrant, supportive, and deeply united. From the very start,
my seniors in Badminton made EJ feel like home, and as I grew into my own
leadership roles, I found immense joy in being part of such an energetic
and passionate community. Of course, there were times of stress, but what
made all the difference was the people: the friends who ate, played, laughed
and mugged with me, the teachers who went above and beyond, and the cleaners
and canteen vendors who greeted us with warm smiles every day. EJC has
given me a family, a place where we push each other to be better while
celebrating every victory, big or small.</p>
<p>
<br>Looking ahead, my goal is to work in the intersection of science and technology,
creating solutions that improve lives - whether in healthcare, defence,
or beyond. I’m excited to carry everything I’ve learned here at EJ, with
all its energy and warmth, into the next chapter of my journey."</p>
