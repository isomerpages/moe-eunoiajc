<p>As President of the 7th Student Council, Nicole Tedja is not just a familiar
face to many – her story of perseverance, friendships and personal growth
charts the path of a Leader with Courage and a Youth with Purpose. She
shares her journey as a learner and a leader, revealing the grit and inspiration
which contributed to making her Valedictorian (Science) for the Class of
2024:</p>
<p>“My academic journey in Eunoia Junior College was marked by struggle,
revelation, and quiet resilience. Initially, the daunting language barrier
coupled with my weaker linguistic skills found me doubting my ability to
navigate the complexities of China Studies in Chinese (CSC). Yet, this
fear was met with immense support from those around me. My teachers, Sun <em>laoshi</em> and
Cao <em>laoshi</em>, patiently broke down challenging concepts outside of
class. My classmates readily translated lecture materials during our first
few lectures. Their unwavering encouragement became a lifeline, helping
me bridge the chasm between doubt and understanding. This journey not only
deepened my understanding of China in her own tongue but also revealed
that true comprehension requires engaging with the complexities of a subject
and acknowledging the nuances that often elude surface-level analysis.
Through this process, my initial doubts transformed into a profound appreciation
for both the subject matter and my own capacity for growth!</p>
<p>As Singapore’s youngest junior college, we had no centuries-old legacy
to inherit, no established reputation to lean on — only a relentless hunger
to prove, to push, to create. Yet, beyond ambition, there was something
more precious: the way we came together as a college. This took place in
the deafening cheers at NSG, not just in victory but in defeat; in the
standing ovations at performing arts showcases, celebrating the culmination
of friends’ dedication and efforts; in the conviction that Open House was
never just an event, but a declaration of who we were, what we stood for,
and why we mattered. These are the moments which have stayed with me from
my journey in EJ. They showed how excellence was never a solitary pursuit
but a collective journey. And I believe that this spirit will endure –
not only within EJ’s walls but also in each of us who have been transformed
by our time here.</p>
<p>I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my class, 23-U5! We began
our journey as <em>The NPC Combi Class</em>, an eclectic mix of PFME, PFMCsc,
and PCMCsc. Yet, what truly defined us were the cherished memories we created
along the way: our laughter-filled planning sessions for a class trip to
JB, our lunchtime strategies to beat the queues, the joy we shared during
our time in Taiwan on the Eunoia GO (BSP) trip, and the delightful chaos
of J1 PW!</p>
<p>I will deeply miss being surrounded by such passionate individuals who
dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to various aspects of JC life, who
celebrated each other’s successes and supported each other through challenges.
Thank you for being a class that was both inspiring and uplifting – simply
put, one I can’t imagine having to go through JC without!”</p>
