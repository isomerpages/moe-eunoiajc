<p>As House Captain, Nathan Neo (23-I4) embodied incredible maturity and
initiative. His ability to critically adapt and communicate effectively
made a significant impact on those around him.</p>
<p>“My EJC journey has been one of many highs and lows. However, each milestone
has played an invaluable role in my learning and growth to be a better
leader and a better friend to those around me. Looking back, the people
that I have met during this journey taught me so much more than I could
ever imagine, even when some of those lessons were undeniably challenging.
To me, the biggest lesson that this community taught me is that in everything
that we do, the bonds and relationships that we have forged is the most
important takeaway. Even after graduating and moving on to a new phase
of life, I am endlessly grateful for the people I have met; the same people
who have seen and guided me in my time in EJC and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will never forget the moment that Isami won our first-ever championship
during the 2024 J1 Orientation. It was especially memorable because of
the events that led up to it, where we went through many setbacks and challenges
together as a House. During those times, it was amazing to see how we kept
our spirits and morale high throughout. Eventually, when our effort and
energy paid off, I realised that we had come so far together as a House.
I will always hold the unity and camaraderie displayed during Orientation
close to my heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to thank my family for their constant support and understanding,
especially on the days when I stayed out late for work or social gatherings.
I am also grateful for my Housemasters and mistress, for walking this journey
with me and guiding me to a better version of myself. To my fellow Captains
and Vice-Captains from Isami and the other Houses, thank you for being
such a passionate community that has been a significant part of my EJC
journey. To my current J3 and J2 Isami House Committee and Isamigos, thank
you for being my reason to keep going, for being such a vibrant and energetic
community that will support each other through the wins and the losses.”</p>
