<p>A compassionate and driven student leader, Rachel Malcolm has exemplified
outstanding commitment to service through the Community Engagement Scholarship
Programme. From volunteering with REACH Family Service Centre to spearheading
the Akila community engagement project for Deep Dive Day #2, she has demonstrated
remarkable maturity, problem-solving skills, and a deep sense of responsibility.
An inspiring role model to many, she shares how the school’s vibrant culture,
inspiring teachers, and close-knit friendships have shaped her growth and
deepened her passion for service:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My time in EJC was truly transformative – pushing me beyond my comfort
zone while giving me the freedom to grow and explore. More than just a
school, EJC fostered a culture that encouraged holistic development. With
the support of inspiring teachers, I was able to pursue passions I had
never explored before, seizing opportunities that once felt out of reach.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the most meaningful parts of my EJC journey was being part of the
Community Engagement Scholarship Programme. With the guidance of dedicated
teachers like Ms Iris Lee, every experience pushed me to grow as a servant
leader – not just for EJC, but for the wider community as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Spending time at REACH Family Service Centre, just across the road from
EJC, opened my eyes to how fortunate I am to have the chance to learn and
grow in this school. It made me want to share that same excitement for
discovery with children who might not have the same opportunities. I was
lucky to work alongside other passionate Eunoians to host reading sessions
for kids in our community, and seeing their faces light up reminded me
why service is so important. Knowing that even small efforts could bring
joy and make a difference gave me a sense of purpose towards dedicating
my time to projects like these.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My EJC journey wouldn’t have been the same without the friends who stood
by my side. Nothing brings people closer than navigating tough times together
– being each other’s support system, and celebrating every achievement,
big or small. I’m grateful for the friends who taught me to find the silver
lining in every challenge and inspired me to make the most of every opportunity
EJC had to offer.”</p>
