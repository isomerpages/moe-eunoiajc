<p>Bryan Lee (23-U5) is an exemplary student who pursued Mathematics and
Sciences with passion as an ETPS scholar and a Further Mathematics student,
while also giving his best in his House and Badminton CCA.</p>
<p>"Heading to EJC, I was prepared to participate in what I am passionate
about, but really focus on my academic studies. However, the energy in
EJC really is infectious, and I found myself investing my time into things
I never thought I would, like House committee and CCA dinners, and enjoying
every moment of them. As I focused on my subjects of interest almost obsessively,
taking H2 Mathematics and Further Mathematics, and H3 Mathematic), my schoolmates
drew me into a more holistic JC experience. All in all, I have no regrets
throughout my EJ journey, only gratitude for the friends I’ve made and
the things I’ve achieved.</p>
<p>I was deeply inspired by my fellow Eunoians. Moments like Eurun, or Spartan
where I saw the house dig deep together really gave a sense of camaraderie.
Academically, working through&nbsp; the same problems together, and experiencing
a sense of satisfaction at solving them together really gave meaning to
studying. The sense of suffering and succeeding together made it a lot
easier to continue striving and working hard.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to further pursuing my passion in Mathematics, taking
it as a university course. Eventually, I hope to follow in my teachers’
footsteps, learning from their example and become a professor, to share
my passion for the subject with like-minded people."</p>
