<p>Lee Kiho (23-I4) was a Class Chairperson with outstanding leadership qualities,
committing to being inclusive, authentic and supportive of his classmates.
He helped the class build strong relationships with each other through
initiatives like creating online study groups and through his sensitivity
to the dynamics within the class. His efforts to motivate and be a role
model for his peers were exceptional.</p>
<p>“My two transformative years in JC helped me discover what I truly want
for myself and others. Beyond academics, the priceless experiences, opportunities,
and the environment shaped my goals and identity, teaching me to find confidence
in myself and the person I aspire to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking back, I can confidently say I made the best of my time here, and
I hope I’ve helped others do the same through my various roles.</p>
<p>What drove me during my time in EJC was a deep sense of curiosity and
the desire to make the most of every opportunity. I was eager to explore
uncharted waters, seek new experiences, and push myself beyond my comfort
zone. Realising how important it is to have something to work toward inspired
me to help others in their own journeys as well. Whether it was through
academic support, offering a listening ear, or simply being there for my
peers, I found fulfillment in supporting others on their journeys, just
as I was navigating my own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be the same person I am today without the help of so many incredible
people along the way. Firstly, I thank my debate coach who gave me a shot
despite being someone with no prior experience, offering thoughtful advice
and guidance that shaped my growth. Next, to the teachers that trusted
and supported me, going the extra mile and engaging in genuine conversations
that made a lasting impact on me. My friends who walked alongside me through
both tough and fun times. I want to express my gratitude to a wonderful
life coach and a friend, Mr Steven Lyu, who guided me to discover confidence
and more through our conversations. Most importantly, I am deeply indebted
to my parents for their unconditional love, trust, and support. I’m really
grateful to have been a part of everyone’s journey, just as they were a
part of mine!”</p>
