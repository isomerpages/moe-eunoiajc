<p>As Dance Captain, Haley Lai (23-E3) balanced the high expectations of
her coaches and teammates with unwavering dedication. Her constant willingness
to help and relentless drive to overcome challenges not only pushed her
own limits but also inspired everyone around her to reach for their best.</p>
<p>“My 2 years in EJ were the most trying yet fulfilling years of my life.
I would describe it as a refining fire. I had to withstand the flames of
academic pressure, navigating friendships and the stress that came with
CCA leadership. Ultimately, I came out of it more resilient, self-assured
and with experiences that I will treasure for a lifetime. This was especially
so in my experience as the Dance Captain of EJ Dance. I had started out
uncertain of my capabilities and unsure of what I had to offer to the CCA.
With the support of my instructors and batch mates, I built my confidence
and found my voice to lead my peers in choreographing dances for school
performances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In whatever season of my JC life I was in, I was constantly inspired by
the people around me. The people I have met in EJ have been some of the
most passionate and driven people I have encountered. Hearing the efforts
of my peers to extend care and love to those in and out of the school community
always inspired me to do likewise in my own sphere of influence. It could
have been something as small as being friendly to school staff or as large-scale
as starting a community engagement project. Being surrounded by such people
made me aspire to be the most purpose-filled and compassionate person I
could be.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for the patience and kindness of my teachers who were
generous with their time to entertain my endless questions. They were the
ones who provided me with the assurance of my academic capabilities and
instilled in me the determination to pick myself up after failure. I am
especially thankful for my life coach, Ms Rachel Yau, who taught me that
there was more to JC than preparing for the next stage of life (presumably
Uni). She taught me that what is important is the kind of person I aspire
to be and the kind of impact I hope to make on the lives of those around
me.”</p>
