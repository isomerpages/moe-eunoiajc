<p>Emma Lee inspires with her passion in the Humanities, and her dedicated
efforts to share such a joy in learning makes her a reliable President
of the Eunoia Humanities Programme (EHP) and a true Thinker with Heart.
She reflects on her own struggles in her journey and how she has grown
to help others overcome their own self-limiting beliefs as well:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My journey in EJ was not always smooth-sailing – it was rife with both
academic and personal struggles. However, through stepping out of my comfort
zone and intentionally pursuing the things that scared me the most, I learnt
to trust myself and my abilities. As someone with a severe case of ‘imposter
syndrome’, the challenges I faced in EJ proved to be especially difficult
yet necessary learning experiences. Additionally, my involvement in EHP
put me in a unique position for positive change,&nbsp; where I was able
to both bolster my personal passion while serving as an advocate for the
arts and humanities in EJ. Despite the moments of self-doubt and uncertainty,
having a strong support system, especially in the form of my friends and
teachers, propelled me to constantly search for ways to better myself and
those around me.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite the countless memories this school has left me, the one that stands
out to me the most is the Eunoia GO (EHP) trip to South Korea. From late-night
convenience store runs to crawling through a tunnel in the DMZ, this trip
was nothing short of exciting yet meaningful. I will never forget moments
like watching the sun set at Namsan Tower or sharing a piping hot corndog
with my friends on the streets of Myeongdong. Beyond the moments of play,
however, what truly stuck out to me was the opportunity to constantly reflect
and engage in rigorous discussions with&nbsp; like-minded peers and my
teachers. Such candid conversations granted me a safe space to not only
voice my perspectives, but to have them challenged by those around me.
Forging new bonds with fellow EHP-peers&nbsp; (and even with the locals!)
and broadening my horizons through every school and historical site visited,
all culminated in an experience I will never forget.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would like to thank my family for being my rock and always reminding
me of the importance of finding strength in the quiet moments before taking
on life’s next hurdle. I am also deeply grateful to&nbsp; my friends (both
old and new) for always believing in me, especially when I struggled to
do so myself. Without their words of encouragement and unwavering support,
I would not have possessed the courage to take (several!) leaps of faith
during my journey in EJC, especially in terms of leadership opportunities.
Lastly, I am thankful for all the teachers, whose passion for the humanities
would always rekindle my own, even in the face of academic fatigue and
stress. Constantly going out of their way to make every lesson just a little
more enjoyable – whether it's through hilarious (and sometimes bizarre)
historical role-plays or blasting Olivia Rodrigo songs during lectures
– is something I have and will always cherish.”
