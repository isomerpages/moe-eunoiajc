In the second volume of an ongoing series, we interview four more Eunoians from our very first cohort. We find out how they have grown from their JC1 experience, what they love most about life in Eunoia, and their aspirations for the college in the near and distant future.

Kimberly, Caspian, Georgia and J'Mie share a common purpose as pioneers to build our identity, to set standards of excellence and establish a shining school spirit. Most of all, they are motivated by the people around them - the Eunoians and teachers who make learning and college life enriching.

##### WHAT IS ONE EUNOIA EXPERIENCE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO REMEMBER?

EJC Orientation. I had the opportunity to participate as one of the OGLs and it is definitely an experience I will never forget. Not only was I given the chance to interact with friends from within and outside of the JIP schools, but I also had the chance to help create the Eunoia culture together with my peers.

##### WHAT DO YOU APPRECIATE MOST ABOUT STUDYING HERE?

What I love most about EJ are the friendships I have made, be it with old friends from SN, or new friends I met through Orientation or my class. These are friends I can trust and count on; they are always there by my side and are willing to help me whenever I need them. For me, these friendships are the best part of my life in Eunoia.

##### WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2018?

What I am looking forward to in 2018 and hope to achieve with the batch of 2018 is to be part of many more firsts and create more EJ traditions together as the first complete Eunoia family. I hope that while creating many more fond memories together, our batch can also leave a long-lasting impact on EJ as the first batch of Eunoians.

Kimberly was placed on both the Dean's List (Academic) and Dean's List (Character and Service) in 2017 for her academic excellence, outstanding contributions to the college and exemplary values.

##### WHAT IS ONE EUNOIA EXPERIENCE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO REMEMBER?

The trials and tribulations of building an entire school culture from scratch, on top of juggling all my commitments. As Captain of Track & Field, Vice-Captain of Isami house and a Student Councillor, JC life has been extremely hectic and sometimes draining for me. However, I absolutely love what I do, even if it means sacrificing sleep and gaming.

##### WHAT IS ONE THING IN EUNOIA YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE PRESERVED?

The spirit to push boundaries, challenge the status quo and forge new paths.

##### WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2018?

I look forward to continue working with my fellow Eunoians and juniors to establish the school, raising the standard of our CCAs, forging a stronger House spirit and making EJ a warmer place for Eunoians to play, study and grow. It will take time, and we may not see the results immediately. However, I believe that with a strong foundation set by my batch along with consistent effort and dedication by our juniors, Eunoia can excel holistically, not just in academics, but in CCA and character development as well.

##### WHY DID YOU CHOOSE EUNOIA JUNIOR COLLEGE?

**GEORGIA:**  I found it exhilarating and also a rare chance to be part of the first batch of students in a newly established college.

**J'MIE:**  I chose Eunoia as I believe that the college will provide me with many different opportunities and platforms for me to learn, exercise my strengths, tackle my weaknesses and excel in the A-Levels.

##### WHAT IS ONE EUNOIA EXPERIENCE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO REMEMBER?

**GEORGIA:**  The lessons! It sounds crazy, especially since it may seem like a boring place to start with, but the classroom is where all the magic happens. I love how my class engages with the teachers and the laughter that engulfs us when someone makes a wisecrack. Apart from the laughter and jokes, the learning experience here is amazing. I doubt that I’ll ever get the chance to throw ideas around and discuss it with great sophistication and wit as I would with my teachers and friends.

**J'MIE:**  An event etched in my mind is the Spartan Race. Spartan Race had many exciting obstacles, but the one that I remembered vividly required me to climb over the monkey bar, then jump onto a hanging tyre to ring a bell. Initially I was hesitant to do it as I was scared that I would fall into the mud underneath. However, my close friends cheered me on and even carried me to the monkey bar. In the end, I overcame the obstacle feeling so touched and satisfied since I thought that I would never be able to do it.

##### WHAT IS ONE THING IN EUNOIA YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE KEPT?

**J'MIE:**  I hope that the fun factor in Eunoia will always stay. Being in JC is definitely tough, especially with the hectic academic schedule and CCA commitments. Throughout the year, we will have events like Amazing Race that will allow us to take a break and relieve some stress by spending quality time with our class mates and school mates.

##### WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE WITH THE 2018 COHORT OF EUNOIANS?

**GEORGIA:**  I hope the batch of 2018 can create an unmistakable mark of both excellence and set the future batches of Eunoians in the right direction, as cliché as it sounds. Excellence, because it is precisely our duty as students to achieve academic excellence and scale new heights. Setting the right tone and direction, because as the first batch we have the ability to mould the whole Eunoia family and identity into something wholly unique and awesome.

Both Georgia and J'mie are Student Councillors. Georgia is the Deputy President of Student Council and a [**Humanities Programme**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/special/hsp/) student. J'Mie is a member of EJC Dance, with whom she clinched the SYF 2017 Certificate of Distinction.
