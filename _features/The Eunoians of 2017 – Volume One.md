In this ongoing series, we speak to our first cohort of Eunoians to catch up on their best memories of 2017, and discover their hopes and dreams for the year ahead. Who is the Eunoian? What is the Eunoia they want to create like? What makes Eunoia special? Kai Ling, Jeff, Joan and Weihan's reflections, like those of our many pioneers, form an important part of the Eunoia story, a story we will write as one in 2018.

##### WHAT IS ONE EUNOIA EXPERIENCE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO REMEMBER?

Spartan Race, where our house - Uzuri - emerged as champions! I guess it was around that time that Uzus were more familiar with each other, and everyone was more eager to take part in house activities leading up to the various challenges. I truly felt then that our vibes as a house were really great because we had a common goal and were motivated to achieve it.

##### WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2018?

As the pioneer batch of students, we did not have seniors to guide us and show what house spirit is like. Having set the foundation of Uzuri house as Vice-Captain, I am definitely excited to see our five houses grow and become stronger through the next batch's efforts. I hope that Eunoians from all five houses can work together to create a fun and exciting environment in Eunoia.

Kai Ling is Uzuri House Vice-Captain (2017-18) and attained a Certificate of Distinction at SYF 2017 with EJC Dance.

##### WHAT IS ONE EUNOIA EXPERIENCE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO REMEMBER?

The Eunoia G.O. trip to Xi’an is still fresh in my memory; I definitely want to remember this. Although I have been to China countless times, I certainly gained more than I expected. Apart from the museum visits that excited my inner History Buff, our meet-ups with different locals and Singaporeans based in Xi’an have inspired me to remain passionate for the things and people I love.

##### WHAT IS ONE THING IN EUNOIA YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE PRESERVED?

The spirit of pioneering is something I hope will be kept. The future batches of Eunoians will probably never get to experience much of the struggle in setting up their own CCAs, Houses or plan their events from scratch, but I really hope that the spirit and freedom to make their own change can come in small and little ways.

Jeff is a Eunoia **[Humanities Programme](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/special/hsp/)** student, a recipient of the [**MOE Humanities Scholarship**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/scholarships/moe-preu/humanities) and a Student Councillor.

##### WHY DID YOU CHOOSE EUNOIA JUNIOR COLLEGE?

**JOAN:**  Eunoia is one of the schools that offer the subject combination of History, Economics, Mathematics and Music. Particularly because music is something I am really passionate about, I wanted to go to a school that offered the Music Elective Programme (MEP) to learn more about the discipline and its history. What made me put Eunoia as my first choice was the impression I took from visiting the college's Open House. I met a few of the History and Economics teachers, and they shared more about the syllabus of the subjects they teach. Through interacting with them, I felt they were not only knowledgeable, but also really enthusiastic and passionate about their subjects. In addition to that, I was drawn by the fact that the school had quite a number of facilities, especially the MEP Rooms and Music Practice Rooms, not to mention the collection of books in the library.

After a year in Eunoia, I think the school is special. It is not just a place to study for the A-levels, to get good grades, but also a school that helps guide us to find what we want to do most in our life and empower us to take heart and chase these dreams.

**WEIHAN:**  I remember coming across a Eunoia poster for Direct School Admission (DSA) in my secondary school, which read “Be the First to Create a legacy, Pioneer a CCA and Make it Happen”. I thought to myself, how often do we get to be a pioneer of a JC in Singapore? That is why I chose Eunoia.

I’m looking forward to continue to establish the Eunoia identity in my second year, build school spirit and form strong bonds between seniors and juniors. Personally, I would think that having a buddy system would be great, so that we can get to know at least one of our juniors really well.

##### WHAT DO YOU APPRECIATE MOST ABOUT STUDYING HERE?

**WEIHAN:**  I really appreciate how Eunoians all want to do extremely well, but we never compete amongst ourselves. There definitely was some friendly competition among friends, but we never compromise each other’s learning just to do better than one another. My friends and I would always study together during the night study sessions and we would always help one another, through sharing of notes and teaching each other complicated concepts. Whenever I didn’t do as well academically, my friends would be there to encourage me and my teachers never ever gave up on me. I remember doing very badly for the Mid-Year Examination, and my teachers never rejected any of my request for consultations and would always reply to my questions over WhatsApp, even in the middle of the night. I really appreciate and love my friends and teachers for their support.

**JOAN:**  I think what I love most about studying here would be the people: the teachers and the friends I’ve met. For one, the teachers care a lot about us, and they’re willing to go the extra mile to help us, be it with school work or other matters. For example, my MEP teacher willingly met with me for consultations to help me with my application for an external music workshop that I really wanted to get into. He gave me advice and constructive comments on how to improve, despite knowing that this would take up a lot of time, and that it was not part of school work. I also enjoy my life coaching sessions with my life coach, the time and efforts she dedicates to hear me out, and guide me in career choices and life. It makes me happy that our teachers are encouraging and supportive towards our dreams.

Secondly, I'm really grateful for the friends I’ve made here. I’m in an Arts class with 13 different subject combinations. Initially, I thought I might not have a lot in common with my classmates given our diverse interests. And it’s true that all of us were very different! But strangely, we got along really well, and it was through these differences that I learnt more about them, grew closer to them, and also picked up a new skill or two. The friends I’ve made come from all walks of life, with very different backgrounds, but it’s these differences that made every day of my JC1  life exciting and unique, and created the fond memories I hope to keep.
