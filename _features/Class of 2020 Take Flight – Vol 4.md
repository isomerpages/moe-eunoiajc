### Chua Wei Ting

**ALUMNA OF CHIJ ST NICHOLAS GIRLS' SCHOOL**

**Chua Wei Ting (19-E3)** was a highly intelligent and conscientious student who consistently featured on the Dean’s List (Academic). Possessing a natural flair for language, she was a recipient of the MOE Spanish Language Elective Scholarship and offered H2 Spanish. As Head of Video Training and Module in the Media Club, despite not having prior experience in the technicalities of producing videos, Wei Ting picked up filmmaking skills on her own through online tutorials and conducted sessions to help them develop their skills in video production. Despite her multiple commitments such as the Pre-University Seminar, the 8th International Biomedical Quiz and Our Singapore SG75, Wei Ting still found time to help in community Service Learning Projects, demonstrating a strong sense of purpose, heart and courage.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I am quite happy and thankful for my results, and grateful for the support I have received from my friends, family, and teachers. My friends were a constant source of love and support for me - from being my study buddies in the library, to providing academic support and ensuring that I had regular breaks and time to unwind. I also appreciated how school facilities like the library continued to stay open in spite of the pandemic, providing me with a space to concentrate, and opportunities to consult teachers. Lastly, I am thankful to my family for their unconditional support and love.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

If I could choose a single word to embody my Eunoia experience, it would be “unprecedented”. I experienced many firsts throughout my JC years, both in my academic and personal life. Some of the biggest contributors to my JC life were my friends, who supported me through every step of the way, as well as my teachers, who were unendingly patient in providing guidance - from answering hundreds of questions on WhatsApp, to sacrificing their rest days for work-from-home consults.

##### WHAT ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

The phrase that grounded me through my challenges and difficulties was: “It gets better”. Lightning never strikes twice at the same place, and things are bound to get better. Many things in life are a state of mind, and the first step in many good stories is to fake it until you make it.

### Tan Hon Jung

**ALUMNUS OF CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL**

**Tan Hon Jung (19-U3)** was a student leader, Hon Jung believed in empowering the people around him and respecting their opinions. As House Captain, he helmed the organisation and coordination of Uzuri House events such as House Parties and House Signature Events. Jung empowered his House Committee Members by encouraging the sharing of ideas and adopting them in organising House activities. He recognized and harnessed the different strengths and capabilities of his House Committee members, nurturing them into leaders. When it came to making changes to the Orientation Programme so it could be carried out safely amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, Hon Jung exhibited grace under pressure and adapted activities deftly to suit Safety Management Measures. He was tenacious in overcoming challenges and forged a strong camaraderie amongst his team.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I was elated with my results as I achieved the rank points that I was aiming for, and would be able to enter most courses that I am interested in. Although I feel that I might have let certain teachers down for some of my subjects, I know that I have done my best and, thus, the only way from this point is to continue moving forward. I am thankful for all the people that I have met in my JC life, as well as my supportive family, schoolmates and teachers, who had faith in me throughout and constantly provided me with the help I required.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

It's been an eventful and fulfilling two years in this school. During this time, I managed to take part in many activities that I would never have imagined myself partaking in. This taught me a lot of new things about myself too. It truly has been an unforgettable and memorable experience in Eunoia and I really owe it to those around me, from my friends who were my daily motivation for coming to school to various individuals whom I work with to organise school-wide events.

##### WHAT WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO OVERCOME THEM?

I would advise my juniors to learn the importance of balancing work and rest. It might get tough and you might feel disheartened at times but don’t lose sight of the bigger picture. As long as you keep the end goal in mind, hustle on, and trust the process. All will turn out to be fine, and it will all be worth it in the end. Also, make sure you have a strong support system around you and reach out for help when you need it! Take care of one another and everything will be okay.

### Gan Ga-Lan

**ALUMNUS OF ST PATRICK'S SCHOOL**

**Gan Ga-lan (19-E5)** was a diligent and focused student with a positive learning attitude. A reliable and competent leader, Ga-lan was elected to be the Creative Director during the Eunoia Global Orientation Programme to Taiwan in 2019. As a Student Ambassador, he shared his personal learning experiences at many outreach sessions to several secondary schools. He also led campus tours for visitors during college-wide events such as College Day and Open House, and initiated many meaningful conversations with them. Ga-lan stepped up to be part of the planning committee of Eunoia Fiesta, raising funds for the college. Kind and helpful he took the initiative to help his peers who could use added support. He demonstrated excellent time management skills and mental resilience managing both his studies and extra-curricular commitments.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I feel really elated and blessed to have attained good results at the A-Level examinations. Although there were many challenges I faced, my friends and teachers always helped to keep my head up during the final stretch, consistently encouraging me. For example, they would always be ready to answer my questions. Furthermore, they would occasionally bring tidbits and drinks to help encourage me. I also have to specially mention my family. They were there to see me at my worst. When I felt like giving up, they would always take the time amidst their busy schedules to comfort me. All these sources of encouragement fueled me to do well for the A-Level examinations. Without their seemingly small acts of motivation, I wouldn't have done as well as I did.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My two years in Eunoia were a rather interesting journey. To this day, I still remember the day I received my Junior College Posting results. I vividly remembered feeling disheartened as Eunoia Junior College wasn’t my first choice. In addition, I was the only one from my secondary school, Saint Patrick's Secondary School, who was posted to Eunoia. I remember panicking as I worried about whether I would fit in. However, after the past two years, I am proud to say that I enrolled in EJC. The memories forged with my class, CCA mates, and teachers have made it a memorable journey. I can’t help but especially thank my close friends whom I’ve bonded with in the past two years. They have been with me through thick and thin. When I went through a dark patch in my life, they were strong pillars in my life and supported me back to my feet during that time. I would say that only in EJC could I have met so many caring teachers and friends. The teachers in EJC are not only driven but dedicated to helping the students here. If given this opportunity to go back in time to pick a different school, I would insist on enrolling in EJC. The past two years have been filled with many great memories and experiences. From being sad about being posted to EJC, I now feel proud to be a part of Eunoia.

##### WHAT WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO OVERCOME THEM?

I think one piece of advice I would like to share with my juniors is to not be afraid. Being the ‘odd one out’ at first made me afraid of trying and starting new things. I felt that because of this fear, I didn’t make full use of my time in EJ. If there is a particular cause or activity you want to start, I would fully encourage them to start it. As my teacher, Ms Iris Lee, once told me, “It is better to become than to stay in the becoming." What this means is that one should always strive for what you are really passionate about. Don’t let your fears hinder the pursuit of your passion.

### Teo Jia Yi

**ALUMNA OF CHIJ ST NICHOLAS GIRLS' SCHOOL**

**Teo Jia Yi (19-E3)** was an intelligent and versatile thinker who loved German and attained the MOE German Language Elective Scholarship. She volunteered to be part of German Opportunities Day, an event aimed at introducing German culture to Singaporeans. Jia Yi also served as an outstanding leader who contributed immensely to strengthening house and college pride. As the House Representative for her class, Jia Yi rallied the class to participate in House competitions and was involved in the planning of House activities. She enthusiastically seized opportunities for growth, and was a role model to her peers, possessing the mental and physical stamina to take on rigorous challenges with impressive grace and calm. 

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I am very happy and thankful that my efforts paid off at the end and I felt that surviving this arduous journey was worth it. I could not have gotten through this long journey without the help and support of the people around me, especially my friends who supported me endlessly, by staying back together, working on assignments during our free periods, or having heart-to-heart talks. I am also immensely grateful for my tutors who often gave me lots of valuable advice during consultations. I would also like to thank my classmates from 19-E3 for always being there for one another, and my 8-men Biology class where I made many enjoyable memories.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My two years in EJC have been a special part of my life, allowing me to take away numerous memories from school events, such as Orientation, Inter-House games and House Signature Events. JC has taught me to cherish the mundane things in life and the many little experiences I’ve had with the people around me — be it the times we sprinted from Ghim Moh Food Centre back to school in time for lectures, or the days I stayed back late in school with my classmates to prepare for the A-Levels. These moments brought me much joy when everything seemed bleak and helped me pull through the tough times. Lastly, my school life would not have been as meaningful without the people I spent it with — my dearest friends, my tutors, and my parents.

##### WHAT WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO OVERCOME THEM?

JC life can be extremely daunting and challenging given its academic rigour and the numerous commitments we have to juggle. However, I have learned that I am not alone in this journey and that there are people I can depend on. Hence, don’t be afraid to seek help when you need to — be it from your peers or teachers — and be proactive in your learning! Nevertheless, the A-Levels is not everything there is to JC; have fun while it lasts. All the best!
