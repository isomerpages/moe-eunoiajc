Our First Class of Eunoians have shone brilliantly in the college's beginning years. For this fourth volume, we heard from Isabel, Zi Hao and Zann Yee from the pioneer cohort of 29 Humanities Scholars on their thoughts, their gratitude for the people around them and the encouragement they hope to share with their juniors. Read more from our first class in Volumes **[1](/first-class-1/)**, [**2**](/first-class-2/), [**3**](/first-class-3/), [**5**](/first-class-5/) and [**6**](/first-class-6/).

**Isabel Chan Jia Yi (17-O1)** is a Ministry of Education (MOE) Humanities Scholar. A dedicated learner and writer, she was placed on the Dean's List (Academic) and was the top student for H2 Geography in the cohort for both 2017 and 2018. Highly driven and all-rounded, Isabel exhibited strong leadership as a Student Councillor and the Vice-Captain of the Hockey (Girls) team. As the overall IC, she rallied her team of councillors to successfully organise the college's first Teachers' Day Celebrations. Her passion, tenacity and discipline brought the Hockey team together, who emerged as 1st runners-up in the 'A' Division Championships in 2018. Isabel also showed great initiative and care for the community, participating in a Values-in-Action project at Gracehaven, embarked on a campaign with World Vision's 'My Vision' programme to raise funds for worldwide access to education, and laid the ground for the college's Community Mapping programme in Ghim Moh. Isabel's legacy is evident for all to see - she is one of two student-designers behind the college's white and grey pin-striped uniform.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I am very thankful and blessed for the results I have received. The past 2 years were mentally, physically and emotionally challenging. If not for my parents and friends who stayed by my side and supported me, it would have been extremely hard to get through the A-Levels. I am also extremely grateful to my teachers who have always been so dedicated and committed, for being so invested in our wellbeing. They really gave us the strength to push through

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

It was a time I saw myself grow and mature. I started to figure out what I was passionate about, found people I was extremely grateful for, and encountered many new experiences.

My teachers - not just the teachers in EJ but also the many who guided me in my secondary and primary school (CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School). My parents who always support and guide me, and my friends who have shared both laughter and tears with me.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Work hard, but ultimately believe in yourself. Often times, you are more capable than you give yourself credit for. At the same time, take time for yourself and appreciate those around you because you are not alone. Even though the process may be rough now, you’ll get through!

**Tan Zi Hao (17-U1)** is an exemplary learner and a generous friend whose commitment, organisational skills and spirit of inquiry stand out amongst his many qualities. As part of the college's Humanities Scholarship Programme (HSP) class, he served as a HSP ambassador advising his juniors on the programme and their subject combination choices. His passion for History and International Relations inspired him to take on a H3 Geopolitics module on the Geographies of War and Peace at the National University of Singapore and take part in the 8th ASEAN Quiz with two classmates. Together they emerged champions at the national level and represented Singapore regionally in December 2018. As a founding member of EJC Drama, he was versatile as an actor and scriptwriter, contributing in both capacities for the group's original production at the Official College Opening. On top of his creative and intellectual aptitude, he was forthcoming in supporting his classmates who faced challenges in Mathematics. 

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I am happy with my results, with great appreciation and gratitude to many people in my life. My parents have provided me with the encouragement for me to push through obstacles and get through disappointments. My teachers have generously imparted knowledge, and my friends have always been there to help me when needed.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My classmates have always contributed to a helpful and conducive learning environment. My teachers have gone the extra mile to clear any doubts I have and to mark additional work I have done.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Always prepare early. Never be complacent about the amount of time you have.

**Wong Zann Yee (17-U1)** is a recipient of the MOE Humanities Scholarship who performed admirably in her academic pursuits, working industriously to place on the Dean's List (Academic) in 2018 and taking on the added challenge of H3 Literature in English. She was also the college's nominee for the inaugural Edwin Thumboo Prize for Literature. Her strong leadership and management was demonstrated not only as Class Chairperson, but also as an Ora House representative, the Head of the Community Engagement Wing in the college's Service Learning CCA and as a student leader in the college's initial Orientation programmes for her own cohort in 2017. Amongst her many service efforts, she has worked with the National Silver Academy, Bethel Community Services, the Bishan North Meet-the-People sessions on self-initiated, CCA-based and talent development programmes.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY TO THE A-LEVELS HERE IN EUNOIA?

The first emotion when my name was flashed on screen was disbelief, then relief. Things felt surreal until I held the certificate in my hands, after which I felt a great burden had been lifted off my shoulders. There was a mix of emotions - happiness, satisfaction and something that I can’t quite explain.

Together with a group of friends, we would study together every day and really encouraged each other to continue pressing on despite the fatigue. My parents and teachers also played integral roles in believing in me and helping me. I am thankful to each and every one who has helped me.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

The two years were fraught with difficult and anxiety, but also joy and happiness. The little moments with friends are what marked the everyday, rather than the grades, which are either little joys or sadness, but never the be all and end all.

The journey was filled with my fellow Eunoians - teachers and fellow student. My classmates whom I am so thankful for the joy they have brought to my life. My friends who have been there for me, and the little pockets of happiness stolen through the rush.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Study hard, but don’t let it consume your whole life. There is always a way to move forward, no matter how bleak it may seem. No grade can determine your strength, courage, character, and kindness - all intangible aspects that should be equal, if not more than the grades you may receive. Have heart and continue moving forward.
