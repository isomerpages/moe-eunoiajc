The SAF Young Leader Award (SYLA) was introduced in 2014 to recognise individuals with excellent academic achievements and outstanding CCA performance. The award motivates students in their continued pursuit of excellence and their journey in becoming future leaders.

The college is proud to announce that two Eunoians from our pioneering cohort, Audrey Choong Jia Yuan (17-O1) and Ryan Lee Ray Yen (17-U2) received the SAF Young Leader Award 2018 from Brigadier-General Fan Sui Siong, Kelvin, Head of the Air Operations Department, Air Force on 16 Jul 2018.

In addition to their keen interest in defence-related issues, Audrey and Ryan have demonstrated outstanding all-round achievement. As recipients of the Book Prize, they will have opportunities to attend SAF functions, defence-related seminars and other engagement activities, as well as a guaranteed scholarship interview.
