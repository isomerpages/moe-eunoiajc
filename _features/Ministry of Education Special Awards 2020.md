**THE LEE HSIEN LOONG AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING BICULTURAL STUDENTS**

The Lee Hsien Loong Award for Outstanding Bicultural students (LHL-OBS) was set up in 2009 to recognise outstanding students in the Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) and the best student in the Regional Studies Programme (RSP).

The Award underpins the strategic importance of developing a core group of bicultural students who are conversant in Chinese or Malay, and are able to engage Asian neighbours as well as relate to the West. This year, three students from the BSP and one student from the RSP received the LHL-OBS.

Rebekah is our alumna from the Class of 2019, and received the Eunoian of the Year Award at our College Day e-ceremony this year.
