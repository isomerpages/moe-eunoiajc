I graduated from the Nanyang Technological University with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering in 2011. I completed my Postgraduate Diploma in Education with the National Institute of Education in 2014 and Master of Science (Exercise and Sports Studies) in 2020.  
I am passionate about Sports and Physical Education and I believe that Physical Education provides one of the best platforms for students to learn life values and skills which could be transferable to their everyday lives. I believe that a good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination and instill a love for learning.

Besides teaching, I am interested in outdoor activities like scuba diving, trekking and playing the game of basketball.

I joined Eunoia because I am confident that this is a school of excellence and the school vision of Every Eunoian a Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage aligns with my teaching philosophy. I look forward to a meaningful journey in Eunoia Junior College and making a difference to our students.
