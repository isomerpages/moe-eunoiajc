I graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2008 with a Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) in Applied Mathematics. In my third year, I participated in the Student Exchange Programme and spent one semester at the University of Edinburgh. It was a valuable opportunity to experience living and studying overseas. From culinary exchanges with my housemates to wandering the charming streets of Edinburgh Old Town and the many weekend trips taken, I formed many wonderful memories with newly forged friendships.

After obtaining my Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education, I taught Mathematics and Physics at a secondary school before teaching at the junior college level in 2012. I have since taught H1 and H2 Mathematics as well as H2 Further Mathematics. I like to constantly reflect on and refine my pedagogy to make learning more effective. I have tried out different teaching approaches such as team-based learning and continue to incorporate some of these elements in my classroom. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a catalyst for educators to explore the use of ICT tools in teaching and learning more widely and deeply. It was a steep learning curve that was very enriching as I learnt the affordances of various ICT tools that could also be harnessed for face-to-face lessons. I like to incorporate some of these in my lessons to engage students and capture their thinking.

I think Mathematics is a beautiful language and I strive to create a safe environment for students to use, appreciate and master this language. I like to pose questions in class to make students think and engage in discussion with their peers. In the process, I hope they can gain a deeper insight into the concepts they are learning. The A-Level syllabus is content-heavy and rigorous, so I think it is important to equip students with the skills and dispositions to make sense of new knowledge and flourish as learners. As a teacher, I also hope to guide and influence my students to become better versions of themselves. I am also constantly learning and improving myself every day so that I may be able to do what I am doing better.

Outside of teaching, I enjoy spending time with my children and family. To de-stress, I like to read and spend time outdoors in nature.

I am excited to join the vibrant Eunoia community and look forward to growing together with this community. I also hope to play a part in practising and nurturing Beautiful Thinking, Goodwill to All.
