Prior to my teaching career, I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts (Second Upper Honours) in History. My time as an undergraduate afforded me the opportunity to do a six-month exchange programme at the University of California, Los Angeles. I then undertook the Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education when I joined the teaching profession.

My teaching career began in a junior college, where I joined a small but close-knit History Unit. I assumed the role of Level Coordinator in my very first year.  That also jump-started my educational leadership journey where I was given opportunities to be JC1 and JC2 Level Coordinator across several years. Having learned from a fantastic group of experienced educators, I went on to assume the role of Subject Head (History), working together with my colleagues to consistently deliver a holistic History education and value-added results each year for our H1 and H2 History students.

I was also involved in Student Leadership for a few years, where I had the privilege of taking charge of the Student Council as well as contributing to school initiatives and policies that help groom student leaders at junior college.  More recently, I also took on the role of Assistant Year Head, looking into pastoral care initiatives for the student population.  Throughout my time in education thus far, I am grateful to have been recognised with the Outstanding Contribution Awards and Top Value-Added Service Award over various years. Most important to me are my interactions, experiences and memories forged with students, colleagues and the wider community, which never fail to remind me of the significance of our work as teachers.

What we learn with joy, we never forget. As a history educator, these words resonate with me very much as I always strive to make lessons fun and engaging so that students enjoy learning about History.  The importance of a history education cannot be understated when it comes to equipping one with the necessary skills to appreciate the past, understand the present and navigate the future.   As Theodore Roosevelt once said, “The more you know about the past, the better prepared you are for the future.”

With the valuable experiences I have gained from my journey in education thus far, I look forward to leading my team to provide Eunoians with an enriching and engaging curriculum that helps them make a difference in their own lives and those of others in society as well.
