I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Economics and obtained a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University.

My teaching career started in a junior college, where I taught H2 and H1 Economics alongside experienced mentors and passionate teachers. In addition, I was involved in the teaching and assessment of Project Work. As a strong believer of a holistic education centred on values, I was a part of the Service Learning Committee. Through organising numerous Values in Action (VIA) projects in the college including Overseas Service Learning Project, college-wide class and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) VIA, I witnessed students develop into socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. As an Economics tutor, I hope to provide students with the knowledge to appreciate economics and excite them about the world to see the role that they can play in society.

As a mother of three children, I strongly believe that learning takes place in caring and safe environments. I seek to create this for my students as well; a safe, positive, welcoming environment for students to learn and grow. I would allow students the opportunity to see mistakes and imperfections as part of the learning process. Through building positive relationships with my students throughout the years that I teach them, I hope to provide them with a relationship they can always turn to in times of joy or struggle.
