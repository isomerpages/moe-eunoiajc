I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Botany. I also hold a Master of Education (specialising in Science Education) from the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University.

My career in teaching Biology, a subject I am passionate about, began in 1991 at a junior college. As a young teacher, I was fortunate to have joined colleagues on a study trip to various schools on the east coast of USA to learn best practices in science teaching and develop better programmes for our students. In 2004, together with a team of teachers from different schools, I was selected for the Teacher Overseas Attachment Programme to The Dolan DNA Learning Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor in the USA as part of the Ministry of Education’s efforts to enhance the learning of Life Sciences in schools. The exposure to, and participation in the many exciting laboratory courses that foster inquiry-based learning resulted in the joint production of a molecular genetics learning package for junior college students. On a personal level, the experience resulted in a firm belief that getting students to think and ask questions is fundamental to teaching and learning.

I am a Senior Teacher in Biology and I have taught Biology at the H2 and H1 levels, and Proteomics at the H3 level. Throughout my years in the teaching service in different junior colleges, I have held positions as co-ordinator and teacher-mentor for multiple programmes such as the H3 Science Research Programme, External Research Programme, and Biology Olympiad Programme. I have served as a Project Work Written Report Assessor for more than five years and was also a member of the Project Work Committee.

Having been a teacher for more than 25 years, I have also served as co-ordinator for the Teacher Mentoring Programme and worked closely with other Senior Teachers as a member of the Senior Teacher Guild Organizing Committee in my previous school cluster. I am currently actively involved in the Network Learning Community to assist teachers in the planning and conducting of Biology practical lessons and examinations. My interactions with many generous and experienced educators throughout my career have made me keen to share my knowledge and experience with fellow teachers. I hope to continue playing an active role and contributing to staff engagement and professional development.

The words of French philosopher, Peter Abelard, hold particular meaning to me as a science educator: ‘…the first key to wisdom, assiduous and frequent questioning … by doubting we come to inquiry; by inquiry we perceive the truth.’ I am excited to be part of this unique team to pioneer ‘beautiful thinking’ experiences that will deepen a love of learning in our students at Eunoia Junior College.
