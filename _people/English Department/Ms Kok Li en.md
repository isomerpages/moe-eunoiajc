I graduated with a degree in law from University College London (First Class Honours) and spent a few years practising law both in the public and private sectors.  I eventually decided to pick my battles, and chose to make the switch from the courtroom to the classroom.  Both have more in common than most would imagine: while many associate criminals with imprisonment, I believe far more are trapped by their inability or unwillingness to gain knowledge about themselves and the world they live in.  In contrast, learning opens new doors that cannot be closed.  That’s why in my classroom, I teach my students to learn – something I hope they will be doing for the rest of their lives.

I believe that the subject I teach, General Paper, particularly lends itself well to an education, not just of the mind, but of the heart and soul as well.  Its end result is a youth who is critically engaged with the world he/she lives in, ready to give an opinion on pressing issues of our age. Such learning is unapologetically difficult, but there’s nothing stopping it from being enjoyable as well!  As a teacher, I hope to be the motivator and instructor who builds that bridge from apathy to curiosity.

My philosophy about teaching has unsurprisingly been shaped by many teachers and mentor-figures I have had throughout my life.  To me, they made all the difference in my growing years – not because of the slips of paper they helped their students attain, but for the irreversible change that they imprinted on our hearts: to see the world differently, to find our place of usefulness, and to live life with a sense of dutiful purpose one step at a time.  I hope to pass this gift on.
