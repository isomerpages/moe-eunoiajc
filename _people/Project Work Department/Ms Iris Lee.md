I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Economics. In my third year as an undergraduate at NUS, I was selected as one of six representatives to go for an exchange programme at the University of Melbourne, Australia. This programme widened my academic exposure on various aspects of Economics. More importantly, I learnt to understand and adapt to the different cultural and community experiences that came with living abroad. Upon graduation, I was appointed as the Assistant Product Manager at an international bank for a year. I was assigned to close trades and work closely with the Relationship Managers. The practical work experience has allowed me to develop my lessons with real world applications.

I started out as an enthusiastic Economics and Project Work teacher in 2010. In the classroom, I encouraged Thinking Routines such as Making Thinking Visible to address the misconceptions that students might have. In Project Work, I was heavily involved in lectures and various training sessions for the professional development of teachers. Having helmed the role of a Civics Tutor for four consecutive years, my students found my guidance and advice impactful. My greatest affirmation as a teacher was to be awarded the Most Outstanding Civics Tutor of the Year in 2014.

In the words of Joseph LeConte, the essential thing is not knowledge, but character. As an educator, I have worn many hats as a public speaking trainer, a character development trainer, a pastoral care and career guidance figure and a cheer leader to encourage students to seize opportunities and perform above their potential. My experiences have taught me that patience and passion are two key driving forces in moulding the future of our nation. Along with these two key forces, it is also important to support students in their search for a meaningful purpose in life and to encourage them to pursue their passion and dreams. I am excited to be part of the Eunoia Junior College family and I look forward to both the challenges and opportunities ahead.

I am a yoga enthusiast and I love to travel and explore the world! Recently, I have been trying to develop my artistic side by picking up calligraphy and watercolour painting. I am a vegetarian because I love animals and believe in caring for the environment.
