I graduated from Tianjin Normal University with a Bachelor of Chinese Language and Literature. I went on to attain a Master of Education from the National Institute of Education, Singapore.

I taught Chinese and Chinese Literature at senior high level in China for 12 years, achieving first place in ‘Tianjin Hope’, a competition based on teaching ability and publishing academic essays on teaching. In Singapore, I taught at a secondary school for 12 years, adding value to the ‘O’ and ‘N’ Level results of my graduating classes. I have also received an Outstanding Contribution Award in my previous school as well as a special teaching award, which earned me the following remarks from my previous Principal and Vice-Principal: ‘Well-Loved by her students, respected by her colleagues and valued by the school, Mdm Chen is an asset in the education fraternity and an inspiration to all educators.’

I believe that students learn best when there is a positive relationship between teacher and student; as a teacher, I believe that I must maintain high expectations of my students and learn continuously for myself. I personally love to recite poetry and sports such as swimming, table tennis and badminton.

Having taught Chinese language and literature at various levels, I am very keen to teach in a junior college, and hope to share the classical and modern Chinese literature research I completed over the course of my Master’s education. I am happy to work with teachers and students to build the EJC culture and its future.

_Lili joined the college as a pioneering member of staff in 2017._
