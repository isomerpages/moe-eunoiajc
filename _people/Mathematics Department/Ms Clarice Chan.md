I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Second Upper Honours) from the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, majoring in Business Analytics. Thereafter, I completed my Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education. During my undergraduate course, I had the opportunity to lead teams of students for Overseas Service Learning Projects to the Philippines and Vietnam. One of the highlights of the trip was witnessing my team members’ personal growth and change in mindset.

Before joining Eunoia Junior College, I taught Mathematics in two secondary schools. These experiences helped affirm my passion for Mathematics and I hope to share my knowledge with my students so that they can see the beauty of the subject as well.

I believe that every child has the right to learn and succeed. This helped shape my teaching philosophy, “No child gets left behind”. I believe that every one of them can lead a purposeful life and it is my goal to help them achieve their greatest potential. Most importantly, I want my students to never stop questioning and always stay curious. I personally live by the quote: “He who asks a question may be a fool for five minutes; he who does not, remains a fool forever.”

Outside of teaching, my favourite activity is to travel and explore the world. I love to go on long hiking trails in the hills as I find them challenging. My experiences taught me that hard work will pay off and have made me a more resilient person. My greatest accomplishment to date is to have climbed Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the British Isles.

It is my privilege to be part of the Eunoia family and I am excited to have the opportunity to design activities and programmes to help shape the Eunoia identity. I look forward to working with students to help transform them to youths with purpose, thinkers with heart and leaders with courage.
