I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor in Civil Engineering. Thereafter I joined the Ministry of Education and had my first stint in education as a contract teacher. The experience convinced me to pursue teaching as a career, which has been rewarding. I proceeded to complete my Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education and later took up a three-year part-time Master of Education in Mathematics to further my knowledge and teaching skills.

Before joining Eunoia Junior College, I taught Mathematics at other junior colleges, where I had the chance to work with many dedicated and passionate teachers. During that time, I worked with my colleagues to prepare subject material that catered to a diverse group of students. I am thankful for the various opportunities to lead teams in the organisation of various student and staff activities. These experiences were both enriching and fulfilling.

I enjoy interacting with students and seeing them develop into lifelong learners and caring contributors to the community.  In my teaching, I aim to spark the love for Mathematics in my students and inspire them to want to know more. I believe that every student is unique; with guidance and a growth mindset, they will emerge successful in their own way.

I am privileged to be part of the Eunoia family and l look forward to working with fellow teachers and students to develop in every Eunoian a youth with purpose, thinker with heart and leader with courage.
