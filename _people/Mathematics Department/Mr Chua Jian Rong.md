I graduated from the University of Oxford with a Master of Mathematics (First Class) on a Ministry of Education Teaching Scholarship. In my four years in university, I studied a range of pure and applied mathematics, as well as statistics. This helped me to appreciate the beauty, rigour and ubiquity of mathematical thinking. While this was challenging, I am thankful to have had the support of tutors who believed in me and encouraged me to be confident in my own critical thinking.

As a teacher, my aspiration for my students is that they would act out of love: that they study for a love of learning and that their actions are motivated by a love for others. Just as my tutors once did for me, I hope to support my students in this endeavour and help them to overcome obstacles with a growth mindset.

Outside of school, I spend the bulk of my time in Christian ministries. My other hobbies include baking, bouldering, and other outdoor activities. I believe that it is important to keep growing and learning new things, and I hope that my students will live with purpose as well.

Prior to joining Eunoia, I taught in several secondary schools. My experiences there affirmed the positive impact a teacher can have on students, whether in or out of the classroom. I am excited to continue my journey as an educator in Eunoia and look forward to working with my colleagues to leave an impact on Eunoians as well.
