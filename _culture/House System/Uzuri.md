Dearest Cubs

Welcome to our family! You may hail from different places and names, but you are now part of the winning Uzuri family. In this house, we believe that everyone matters and that every Cub is a winner. Regardless of your background, there is a place for all Cubs. In our eyes, you are a winner in your own right as long as you win graciously and respectfully.

In your two years with us, we want you to grow in courage, strength and wisdom. Be courageous to step out of your comfort zone and push new boundaries. Be strong in the face of challenges and become wiser as you experience new opportunities and learn more about yourself and others. The mighty bear in the wild is a strong and fearsome predator, but it is also an unflinching protector of its family. And that is what we value most in the House of Uzuri – everyone is valued and no one gets left behind.

Finally, always remember that at the end of the day, no matter how harrowing the college years may get, bears have one another's backs.

We don’t just play like winners, but we are a family. Uzuri, A Home of Winners where everyone matters.

Your House Masters  
Mr Azhar Amin and Mr Alex Teo
