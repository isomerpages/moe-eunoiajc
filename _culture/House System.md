### Five Houses, One Eunoia

Houses are the heartbeat of Eunoia. The Eunoia House System seeks to promote college experiences through deeper engagement with students in a closer, tightly knit community. Five houses exist to divide the college population into small, permanent, cross-sectional, teacher-led and student-initiated, family-like communities that foster both learning and loyalty. They are led by their respective student-elected House Captains and House Committees, under the guidance of their House Mistresses / Masters.

The five houses of Eunoia take after the college's name. Akila, Eder, Isami, Ora and Uzuri each signify beauty and beautiful thinking in five unique languages from five continents, coming together to form the five main vowels of the English language.

### House Identities

The houses uphold their own distinct identity, including house colours, emblems, flags, mascots and cheers. The pioneer cohort of Orientation Group Leaders conceptualised the identities of the five houses. The house crests were designed by Kay Yeung (17-I2).
