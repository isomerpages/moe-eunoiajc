Physical Education at Eunoia Junior College will be eUnique. It will defy conventional wisdom and be enjoyable. We approach PE differently. Our goal is for you to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. Our Games Concept Approach means you will pick up skills and strategies across different sports and enjoy applying them. You will have the opportunity to do the sports you want to do and also learn a few new ones such as Touch Rugby and Ultimate Frisbee. We are interested in the rules and culture of all sports, our hearts centred on the values of respect and sportsmanship. And we haven’t even mentioned the word fun yet.

Our college-wide events promise a healthy dose of competition. A road run through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, Sports Day and Inter-house Games will certainly challenge you to better yourself. Want to improve your performance or need an extra bit of motivation? Current and former athletes will share their experience and motivations with our college community. Sports science and nutrition workshops help you level up your game. To us, fitness is not about tests. It is about enjoyment and enjoying a healthier life.
