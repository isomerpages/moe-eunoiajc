Beauty is everywhere. Those who see and create beauty can change the world. The college’s Aesthetics Programme fosters creative and critical thinking, and a learned appreciation of the visual and performing arts. Through performances, hands-on workshops and Makerspace activities, you will take a step towards being a connoisseur and creator.

Pick up a guitar to master a riff or two. Learn the difference between serif and sans serif fonts at a graphic design course. If pottery intrigues you, try your hand at making your own unique bowls, vases and ornaments. Choose what you want to experience. Or you could cheer on your peers from our array of Performing Arts CCAs at lunchtime concerts or our performing arts festival. At EJC, art is never far away and beauty is always on our minds.</center>
