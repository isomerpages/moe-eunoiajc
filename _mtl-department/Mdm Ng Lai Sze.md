I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese Studies (Honours) and later attained a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Oriental Studies at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. Before teaching, I worked as a journalist, script-writer and translator in the publishing and media industries.

My career in teaching Chinese Language and Literature began in a junior college, where I was a teacher in the Chinese Language Elective Programme and was also appointed as the e-Supervisor to oversee the smooth running of the e-examinations of the school. In 2014 and 2020, I was invited to the Working Committee of the H2 Chinese Language and Literature by MOE to contribute to the rolling out of the new syllabus. I also taught Project Work in my previous junior college. Such interdisciplinary and cross-curricular training has enabled me to provide students with broader perspectives.

Joining the Eunoia family brings much excitement to my teaching career, as it comprises a team of teachers with a “can-do” spirit, displaying the “entrepreneur dare” to build a school from scratch. I am confident that such collective spirit will bring our college to new heights and frontiers.
