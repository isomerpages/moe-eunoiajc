This writing style guide is a manual of style and format used when working on articles or titles in the English language. It is to be used by members of the college community, including staff, students, parents, alumni, partner schools and partner organisations.

The consistency of nomenclature and editing promoted in this guide is intended to assist those involved in the publication of corporate communications material, as well as documents, material, and programmes for internal circulation.

Capitalisation
==============

The name of the college, Eunoia, should be written in title case. Lower case is used only in selected references to the English word eunoia.

Names of the college's programmes, co-curricular activities, departments, committees and official groups should be in title case.

_E.g. Dance, Hockey, Mathematics, Corporate Communications and Partnerships_

References to 'programme', 'club', 'council', 'department' and 'committee' are written in title case when used as part of the title of the respective entity. All other references should be presented in lower case.

_E.g. Humanities Programme, Media Club, Innovation Committee_

Spelling
========

Spelling should be consistent within the article. When two or more spellings of a word are given, the UK spelling is preferred. Refer to the following examples:

**UK**  _synergise_      **US**  _synergize_

**UK**  _centre_            **US**  _center_

**UK**  _behaviour_      **US**  _behavior_

**UK**  _biological_       **US**  _biologic_

Names and titles should be spelled in full before abbreviations are used. The abbreviation should be placed in parenthesis after the first instance of the name or title.

_E.g. Music Elective Programme (MEP), MEP students, the MEP overseas immersion programme..._

Numbers from one to ten should be written in full, except where decimals and fractions are involved. Numbers between eleven and one hundred may be spelled in full or expressed in numerals.

_E.g. The two-year journey to the A-Level Examination demands..._

Internal references to 'A-Level' and 'A Division' follow the nomenclature set by the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) and the Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC) respectively.

Eunoia Junior College
=====================

References to Eunoia Junior College may take the following variations: 'Eunoia Junior College', 'Eunoia' and 'EJC'.

'Eunoia' and 'EJC' may be used as adjectives to define programmes, student groups, and committees.

_E.g. Eunoia Humanities Programme, EJC Student Council, EJC Softball, EJC Deans' Committee._

References to 'EJ' are considered informal and to be avoided in official names, professional correspondence (e.g. emails), and formal writing (e.g. website articles). These may be used in informal applications such as student cheers.

References to 'the college' should be in lower case, unless used at the start of the sentence.

_E.g. The college is holding its annual Road Run on..._

References to 'junior college' should be in lower case, unless used to refer to Eunoia Junior College and names of other junior colleges.

_E.g. As the latest addition to the junior college landscape in Singapore..._

Eunoian
=======

'Eunoian' is strictly used to refer to students of Eunoia Junior College. It is regarded and applied only as a **noun**.

_E.g. Our JC1 Eunoians embarked on a learning journey to..._

'Eunoian' should not be used as an **adjective** to describe programmes, student groups, committees or college elements. 'Eunoia' or 'EJC' can be used instead.

Use the article 'a', not 'an', before 'Eunoian'. The 'eu' in 'Eunoian' makes the same sound as 'you'. Thus, 'eu' is treated as a consonant sound.

_E.g. A Eunoian does not simply change light bulbs._

References to students as 'J1s' and 'J2s' in their respective levels are considered informal and to be avoided in official college documents, correspondence and programme material. Use 'JC1s', 'JC1 Eunoians', 'JC2s' and 'JC2 Eunoians' instead.
