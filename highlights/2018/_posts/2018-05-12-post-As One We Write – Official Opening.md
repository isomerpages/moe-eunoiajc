<center><em><b>Eunoia Junior College</b><br>Official Opening<br>5 May 2018</em></center>

Eunoia Junior College celebrated its official opening on Saturday, 5 May 2018 with a harmony of sound, colour and learning. In attendance were newly appointed Minister for Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung, Permanent Secretary of the Public Service Division, Ms Yong Ying-I, Chairman of the EJC College Advisory Committee, Professor Su Guaning, senior officials from the Ministry of Education, present and past principals, alumni chairpersons and school management committee representatives from the Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) partner schools, parent partnership group Parents@Eunoia, and the most important guests for the day, our two pioneering cohorts of Eunoians.

The theme As One We Write, taking after lyrics of the college anthem written by present and future Eunoians, reflects the opportunities and responsibilities our students have in shaping the destiny and legacy of the college. The hive of activity, consisting of learning workshops, performances, games and food throughout the day, would attest to the vibrancy Eunoians have brought and will bring for many years to come.

The opening performance, specially choreographed for EJC Dance by instructor Mr Dan Kwoh, served an appetiser for our guests on what to expect — a circus of colour, a feast of learning, and plenty of passion to go around.

Each of us carries within us a story waiting to be told, and together we weave our silken strands into one beautiful Eunoia fabric. Let us tell our story through our heartbeat, our people, our triumphs, our struggles, our comebacks and our prospects.</em></center>

### Fiesta

The day's excitement kicked off in three concurrent segments: a Carnival that showcased our Eunoians' creative games and challenges, an Unconference programme for all to explore a wide array of interests and passions and a Human Library in which participants could 'read' human books that told the Eunoia story from conception to present day.

In the Human Library, our special guests participated alongside our JC1s to listen to the struggles and satisfactions of starting a new junior college. The pioneers they heard from included the past and current principals of our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools, our first cohort of Student Councillors and student-leaders who organised Orientation and many other programmes for their own cohort, the student-designers of our uniform, student-composers of our college anthem, and the parents who stepped up as executive committee members of Parents@Eunoia even before the college began formal operations. As our human books shared their heartfelt moments, our 'readers' shared curious questions and words of encouragement, some even diligently taking notes along the way.

Our guests had the opportunity to visit learning workshops taking place, many initiated and facilitated by the college's students and staff. Minister for Education Mr Ong Ye Kung, together with Director-General for Education Mr Wong Siew Hoong, tried their hand at corsage and boutonniere-making in a session taught by our Principal Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng and student-volunteers. They later had their hands full negotiating a Python coding session chaired by Mathematics teacher Dr Chen Weiqiang, a crash course in juggling by Mr Victor Yang and an introduction to beatboxing led by the self-taught Chin Zhen Yu (17-O4). Greeting Eunoians along the way, Mr Ong also met Mr Jose Pedro Cairos Correa, a Deputy Head Keeper at the Singapore Zoo and his friend, a South American Boa. Elsewhere, other workshops on the Korean language, internet meme-making and crochet taught by Eunoians captivated their peers' attention.

With squeals of excitement inside our classrooms, there was definitely as much fun to be had outside them. Our Eunoians' carnival stalls, ranging from the curious to the familiarly satisfying, promised to fill bellies, tell fortunes, test your skills and your patience, and to scare off the stress of examinations. These certainly tapped on our JC1 students' ingenuity, and expanded on the task their Project Work tutors set them in Term 1.

<center><em>We are passion embodied. We celebrate each other’s talents, interests and dreams — we are home to those venture off the beaten path; we are champions of tinkering and trying. We are our ideas and stories. Eunoia is beautifully different because all Eunoians are individual lights who sparkle in their own unique ways.</em></center>
