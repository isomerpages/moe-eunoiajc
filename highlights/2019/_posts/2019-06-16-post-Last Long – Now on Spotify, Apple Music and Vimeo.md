'Last Long', a song written by Deputy Principal Mr Adrian Tay and performed by Karis Goh (18-A3) and Donavan Bay (17-E5), was launched on Eunoia Junior College's third College Day.

The music video was produced by a team of JC2 Eunoians from EJC Media Club, and the track was produced and arranged by Daniel Wong of [**Ardant Studio**](https://www.facebook.com/ardant.studio/).

The song captures the friendships of our pioneering cohorts and some of the memories they made at our Mount Sinai campus in 2017 and 2018.
