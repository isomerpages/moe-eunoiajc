The college strongly believes in student voice: we empower our students to shape and co-create with us the Eunoia identity. Our students in the Joint Integrated Programme and students who are admitted via the Joint Admissions Exercise are given opportunities to propose CCAs beyond.

The college offers a variety of CCAs designed to cater to diverse interests and abilities. Students can add to this mix by proposing CCAs that they are passionate about.

### Proposal Form

We are currently accepting proposals from Year 4 students in the Joint Integrated Programme. Proposals should be sent to [**eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg**](mailto:eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg) (Attn: Mr Kevin Ang) by **Fri, 2 Sep 2016**.
