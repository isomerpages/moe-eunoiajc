The Internship and Externship Programme at Eunoia Junior College aims to help Eunoians gain exposure and insight into industries of their interests, and to make informed choices with regard to their future courses of study and careers.

Eunoia Junior College is currently sourcing for a variety of opportunities to provide Eunoians with choices that are aligned to their personal interests. The differences between internships and externships are broadly outlined as follows:
