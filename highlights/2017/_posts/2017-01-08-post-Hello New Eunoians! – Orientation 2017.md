**Dear New&nbsp;Eunoians,**

Hello and a warmest welcome&nbsp;to the Eunoia family! You complete us, and with you we write the legacy of Eunoia Junior College. Together with our students from the Joint Integrated Programme, you form our First Class - one that will live in the moment, rise to the occasion, and relish the journey&nbsp;ahead. We promise that you will have many cherished&nbsp;memories and form many beautiful friendships with us as Eunoia Junior College.
