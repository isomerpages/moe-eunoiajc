Welcome to **Parents@Eunoia** 2023, a community for parents of Eunoians by parents of Eunoians!

We are delighted to be the parentsâ€™ voice on matters close to our hearts. As representatives of the parents of Eunoians, we aim to highlight issues such as our children's holistic well-being, university preparation, and career guidance. We seek to organise fun events to nurture parent-child bonding. We also strive to consider the needs of all Eunoians above ours, and forge to build a remarkable learning space and a brighter future for our children.
