#### **Our Name**

![](/images/BeautifullThinking.png)

**Eunoia**&nbsp;(_yoo-noh-iea_) means beautiful thinking, goodwill to all, and a bridging of the heart and the mind. Eunoia is an English word with Greek origins, and is made up of two parts: ‘eu’ meaning good and ‘noia’ referring to the mind.

In&nbsp;_Nicomachean Ethics_, Aristotle refers to eunoia as the pursuit of the good of all, and the desire for the good of the other person in friendships. Friendships are in their fullest and most enduring form when one gives and cares without seeking benefits for oneself.

‘The perfect form of friendship is that between the good, and those who resemble each other in virtue. For these friends wish each alike the other’s good in respect of their goodness, and they are good in themselves; but it is those who wish the good of their friends for their friends’ sake who are friends in the fullest sense, since they love each other for themselves and not accidentally.’

In the words of Aristotle, we believe that ‘Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.’

#### **诺雅的意思**

**诺雅**指的是“君子大雅，有诺必行”。&nbsp;“诺”“雅”这两个字在中文里也个别有它们的意思。“**诺**” 表示 “承诺”，“雅” 指的是高尚，美好的意思。“**雅**” 也代表气质，如优雅的气质，跟 Eunoia 指 Beautiful thinking 的意思相似。&nbsp;因此，我们希望**诺雅初级学院**的学生能成为才学优异、品德高尚、正直守信的人。
