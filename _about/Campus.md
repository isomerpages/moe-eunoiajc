### Bishan Campus

Our Bishan campus is situated at the junction of Sin Ming Avenue and Marymount Road, overlooking Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and both Bishan and Ang Mo Kio estates. It is a seven-minute walk from the Bright Hill (TE7) station on the Thomson-East Coast line and a short bus ride away from Bishan (NS17/CC15) station on the North-South and Circle lines and Marymount (CC16) station on the Circle line.

##### ADDRESS

Eunoia Junior College  
2 Sin Ming Place  
Singapore 573838

##### FACILITIES

Eunoia Junior College is the first high-rise junior college in Singapore, with two academic blocks 10 and 12 storeys high respectively. A duplex library sits at the top of the 10-storey block, allowing for a panoramic view of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. The campus hosts a 900-seater auditorium equipped for performances, seminars and cohort-wide lectures, on top of a range of seminar rooms, learning rooms, science laboratories and other purpose-built rooms.

The college is also the first school in Singapore with an elevated stadium on level 5 as part of its infrastructure. A full eight-lane track and field, space for sports and games, and a viewing gallery will be located at the top of the block adjacent to Marymount Road. The entire structure will provide shelter for various student interaction areas, including music studios, performing arts studios, CCA rooms, a multi-purpose hall, indoor sports hall, interactive arcades and study decks overlooking the park, complemented by green spaces that merge into Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.

##### LEARNING EXPERIENCE

With Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park next door, the campus will be the foundation of our vision — the holistic development of every Eunoian to become a Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage. The abundance of nature is a reminder of Eunoians’ larger responsibility as individuals and leaders, and would greatly enhance the college’s Environmental Literacy Programme, Physical Education and Co-Curricular Activities programme.

Service to the community forms an important part of the Eunoia identity. Our students will enjoy many opportunities to connect with the residents of Bishan and Ang Mo Kio through community mapping and service-learning programmes. The proximity of Marymount Community Club to the college will allow the college to weave community service seamlessly into our curriculum, as our Eunoians make a positive impact on the community.
