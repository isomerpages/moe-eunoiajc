Greetings and welcome to Eunoia Junior College’s website! We are excited to have you and the opportunity to share the opportunities and experiences that await our students.

Even before joining the college, I thought Eunoia was such a thoughtful and appropriate name for a junior college. Eunoia is something we look to imbue in every Eunoian who comes through our gates: a belief in the goodness and beauty of all, a belief in the possibilities ahead of us, and a belief that we can make good things happen. Our Eunoians can make a mark with their lives, making Eunoia and the world around them better for everyone.

Eunoia Junior College was established as a JC like no other – to extend the education of Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) students from our partner schools Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls' School, as well as Eunoians who join us through the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) and Direct School Admission (DSA). The diversity of our student population is something we hold dear to us. We are a college with staff with myriad experiences and from diverse backgrounds, united in our calling to create something special. Committed, competent, caring for the individuals in their charge, they yearn to make Eunoia an exciting place for learning and growth. In the spirit of Beautiful Thinking, Goodwill to All, our students and staff together form an amazing community that nurtures and provides an abundance of opportunities for one and all. Take a look around our website and you will see our Eunoians showcase their [**academic work**](https://ejceudaimonia.com/), initiate [**advocacy projects**](https://www.oheunoia.com/community) and [**interest groups**](https://www.oheunoia.com/siig), discover areas ranging from the [**space industry**](https://staging.d2ftoa31ukircm.amplifyapp.com/curriculum/special/altitude/) to [**public policy**](https://staging.d2ftoa31ukircm.amplifyapp.com/curriculum/special/latitude/), and lead the way in our vibrant [**student life**](https://staging.d2ftoa31ukircm.amplifyapp.com/culture/).
