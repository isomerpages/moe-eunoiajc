I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Second Upper Honours) in 2008 from the National University of Singapore, as part of the University Scholars Programme.

I started my career in education teaching Chemistry in a junior college. During my time in the school, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to be involved in various aspects of student development. This ranged from being a teacher mentor to student leaders, to engaging and supporting the student cohort as a member of the Year Head Committee, to developing in students an appreciation and love for the arts as a CCA teacher-in-charge of Dance. Some of my fondest memories are of the times I spent with the dancers in the studio and in theatres, experiencing dance in different forms and discussing what it meant to each of us.

Prior to joining Eunoia, I was an Assistant Director in the Curriculum Policy Office, where I led a team to support schools in using more holistic assessment to improve teaching and learning. My work in the Curriculum Policy Office sparked my interest in the potential of assessment in education, which led me to pursue a Master of Arts in this area at the University College London – Institute of Education on the Ministry of Education (MOE) Postgraduate Scholarship.

My greatest hope for my students is that they will always remain inquisitive individuals who yearn learning. We can talk about how being an able and willing learner is essential for today's unpredictable world, but beyond such practicalities, I believe that engaging in the process of learning awakens, inspires, and energises the soul. If one is able to be in pursuit of learning throughout one's life, how invigorating it must be!

Being part of the team to start off Eunoia was too exciting an opportunity to miss. I am thrilled to have the chance to work alongside students as well as my fellow teachers to define and construct what Eunoia stands for. I look forward to exhilarating times ahead!
