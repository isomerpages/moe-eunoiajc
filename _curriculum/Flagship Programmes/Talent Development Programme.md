### Growing Leaders with Initiative, Dedication and Empathy (GLIDE)

Transform your strengths into talents. Every Eunoian has strengths, and we want to inspire you to achieve your definition of excellence. Our Talent Development Programme, GLIDE, is a flagship programme centred on all students, leading you to test your abilities and be who you yearn to be: academics, athletes, artists, entrepreneurs, lawyers, scientists or roles only you can dream of.

Get closer to your ambition with our myriad activities, spread across the academic, aesthetic, leadership, service and sporting domains. You will also meet influential people and find out how different talents shape organisations. We want you to discover, explore, perform and then soar, setting personal goals and seeking the opportunities to realise them. Wherever you are on this journey, you will be stretched and inspired to chart your own path.
