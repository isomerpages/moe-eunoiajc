<center><h4><em>“Chase down your passion like it’s the<br>last bus of the night.”<br><b>Terri Guillemets</b></em></h4></center>

Still searching for something worth chasing? You are certainly not alone. The flagship Passion Pursuit programme at EJC will give you a helping hand. We believe that few people find their passion in life because few search for it. Even fewer are able to live out their passion in life, as they have limited opportunities to reflect on how their passion links to their purpose. Here, we will help you discover your passion, realise your potential and pursue your life purpose.

Through Passion Pursuit, you will be invited to diverge, to explore and to dabble in various interest areas, both in and out of school. Your sampling experience should trigger some points of convergence, where you will start thinking more deeply about where your passion lies. When a clearer picture emerges, we will support you as you go forth to live out that passion, be it through a project, a performance, or any other meaningful means. Diverge, converge, emerge — that’s a neat way of thinking about how to pursue your passions!
