Students in the Joint Integrated Programme go through a six-year [World Readiness Programme](/flagship-programmes/wrp/) and [Passion Pursuit](/flagship-programmes/pp/) experience at their respective secondary schools and at EJC. The college will offer a customised two-year experience to students admitted via JAE.

The collegeâ€™s own flagship [Talent Development Programme](/flagship-programmes/tdp/) and [Life Coaching Programme](/flagship-programmes/lcp/) promise to offer all our students a personalised education to help them understand themselves and realise their passions.
