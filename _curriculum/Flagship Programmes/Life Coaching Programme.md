At Eunoia, every student receives individualised coaching. We believe that you have life experiences which can be tapped on for reflection and learning. We believe that you have unique gifts waiting to be awakened or strengthened.

Each student is paired with a member of staff or a school leader, who will connect regularly with you and guide you towards greater self-awareness. The objective is to help you **G.R.O.W.**: to clarify your **G**oals, understand your **R**eality, source for **O**ptions and opportunities, and chart the **W**ay forward. Together we draw life lessons from your experiences in and outside the classroom.
