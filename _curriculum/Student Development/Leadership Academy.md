### Our Philosophy and Framework

Leadership is a journey from within, and we believe that every Eunoian has a sphere of influence. At the core of our leadership framework is our College Vision – Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart and Leader with Courage. To be a leader, a Eunoian does not need a formal position, but needs to have moral courage to stand up for what is right and the courage to create change.

Adopting the Social Change Model of Leadership Development, we also encourage Eunoians to be self-aware, discover their purpose, and have a heart for others. This way, they will seek opportunities to lead for change and lead to inspire. Being self-aware of one’s own strengths is a key aspect of Strengths-Based Leadership which our college also adopts.

### Our Curriculum

We offer every Eunoian the opportunity to deep dive into the topic of leadership through workshops, dialogues/forums, lessons and learning journeys during Deep Dive Day #3. Student leaders will also be guided by their respective teachers (Civics Tutors, CCA teachers and House Masters and Mistresses for example) during their leadership journey.

In particular, the college’s Student Leadership Wing trains and develops the Student Council, Class Directorate (Class Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons), CCA Directorate (CCA Captains/Presidents and Vice-Captains/Presidents) and House Directorate (House Captains and Vice-Captains, House and Sports Representatives) through college-wide Induction and Conferences and the Eunoia Leadership Camp. These groups of student leaders are also guided through a formal retrospection process to make sense of their leadership journey.
