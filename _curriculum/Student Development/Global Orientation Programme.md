Ships in harbour are safe, but that’s not what ships are built for. Go beyond our shores; see, taste and feel other cultures. Through our diverse offering of learning journeys, immersion programmes and service learning projects all around the world, you will widen your perspectives and enlarge your vision of Singapore and the world.

Start local — explore the rich diversity of customs and blending of cultures right here in Singapore. You will go on learning journeys to museums, heritage sites and other intriguing places you never thought existed. By first understanding our own identity, we view the world with new eyes.

Our global footprint begins at our school twinning programme partners, where you will enjoy opportunities to immerse yourself in cultures and learn more about how locals live — experiences hard to come by through your regular family holidays. As a Humanities Programme student, explore the sights and sounds of an Asian nation, to satisfy your artistic, cultural, economic, geographical, historical and social curiosities all at once. In the Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese), you can experience various sprawling cities in China, their natural wonders and their rapidly changing urban landscape.

Just a friendly pre-departure reminder: travel light, because you will return with a lifetime of learning.
