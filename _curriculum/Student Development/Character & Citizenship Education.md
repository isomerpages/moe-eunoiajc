What is a brilliant mind without a beautiful heart and a tenacious spirit? In a time of fading practices and changing norms, strong character stands the test of time. Eunoians possess a deep sense of purpose, empathy for others and the courage to lead, never wavering in the face of adversity or negativity. Here in EJC, we are not just ready for the future. We are ready to influence it, for the good of all.

### Our Curriculum

To do so, our Character & Citizenship Education curriculum takes you on a **R.I.C.H.** journey. You will understand your role in building positive, respectful **R**elationships and reflect on your own **I**dentity and values. We are the sum of our **C**hoices: learning to live out your values in the face of challenges and obstacles is vital. Finally, you will sculpt your vision of **H**ome, and take decisive steps towards building a better Singapore for all.

### Our Enrichment

On this journey, you will take part in learning journeys, forums, debates, talks by invited speakers, national celebrations and efforts of appreciation. You can choose how you want to discover yourself and your role in the world.
