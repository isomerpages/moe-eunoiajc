<h3><strong>MOE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h3>
<p>1. Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to
understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those
with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2. The goals of Sexuality Education are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through
the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;<u>knowledge</u>&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of&nbsp;<u>social and emotional skills</u>&nbsp;of
self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours,
development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication,
problem-solving and decision-making skills; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for
others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society,
through the inculcation of&nbsp;<u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u>&nbsp;about
sexuality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The key messages of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and
unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson, students will learn to navigate challenges in a dating
relationship. This includes identifying unhealthy relationships, when to
seek help, who to turn to for support and to appreciate that one can emerge
stronger and be better prepared for future relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will have a deeper understanding of what dating and family violence

<p><em>Are values such as abstinence of sexual activity before marriage still valid in the world today? Why? Is abstinence a reasonable choice?</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson, students examine issues related to abstinence and explore
the balance between being free to make personal choices and being responsible
for the consequences of their choices. They will understand that, in the
face of conflicting voices and perspectives, they need to focus on integrity,
and choose to act in accordance with sound values and moral principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In so doing, students learn to make responsible decisions for self and
others, and think through the consequences of doing so.</p>

<p>In this lesson, students examine issues related to abortion and the impact
of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and understand that one has
to make responsible decisions for both self and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are also taught to consider sexual abstinence before marriage
to remove any risks that come with casual sex. The lesson will also focus
on being a source of support for others who may be pregnant or have STIs.</p>

<p><em>How does the media portray gender and relationships? How do societal influences affect our understanding of gender stereotypes?</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson, students will recognise that some segments of society
may inaccurately reflect the efforts needed to maintain healthy relationships,
leading to skewed assumptions of sexual messages and connotations within
relationships.</p>
<p>Students will understand how societal influences can skew one’s understanding
of gender stereotypes (e.g. boys should not cry, and are to suppress emotional
sensitivity so as not to seem weak; girls are physically weak and unathletic,
and downplay achievements so as to fit in), which can affect interactions
and relationships in ways that are harmful to themselves and others.</p>

and responsibilities by exploring societal expectations, the laws that
protect teenagers from sexual crimes, and the legal consequences of inappropriate
sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will examine what makes voyeurism wrong, learn the importance
of the law as signposts for desired behaviours and conduct in society,
and the importance of one’s moral compass in responsible decision-making
and choosing to do what is right.</p>

<p><strong><em><u>eTeens</u></em><u> Programme</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is a programme developed by Health Promotion
Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide JC/CI
Year 1 students with accurate information on STI/HIV and protection from
a health perspective so as to enable them to make wise, informed, and sensible
decisions.</p>
<p>7. Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and
negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn
that the impact of STI/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their
family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages. The
desired outcome of the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;programme is that students
are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
<p><strong>At Eunoia Junior College, the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;programme will be implemented as follows in 2025:</strong>
