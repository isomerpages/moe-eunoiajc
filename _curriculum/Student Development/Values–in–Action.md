A little love goes a long way. Eunoians transcend borders to make meaningful contributions to communities, society and the nation. In our Service Learning approach, you will explore issues faced by various groups and imagine new ways to contribute. The possibilities depend on you: the elderly in Bishan and Ang Mo Kio, underprivileged families in Ghim Moh and Queenstown, children with special needs, the flora and fauna along the Green Corridor. Champion a cause you believe in. With purpose, heart and courage, you will connect with the community, help them find their voice and amplify it.  As a change maker, you might just leave an enduring legacy.
