The Music Elective Programme (MEP) provides opportunities for students to develop their music abilities in an enriched environment. MEP students engage in the academic study of music and are nurtured to be scholars, practitioners, advocates and leaders in the arts.

Offering both H2 and H3 Music, our MEP students are guided through inquiry learning to hone their abilities in music analysis, performing and composing. Lessons are conducted in dedicated music studios and practice rooms are available to support MEP students’ music making. Learning extends beyond the classroom in the form of workshops, masterclasses, learning journeys and recitals. These provide for authentic learning and stretch MEP students’ music understanding.

A signature programme is our annual Eunoia MEP concert titled&nbsp;_euphony_, where students are featured in recital and involved in various aspects of planning and organising the concert. As a fitting finale to their journey of growth in Eunoia MEP, students also complete an independent research project under the guidance of a supervisor in an area that they are passionate about.
