The Community Engagement Scholarship programme focuses on the application of ideas of the social sciences to understand, investigate, and examine challenges and issues of contemporary community life. The programme aims to enable, empower and embolden Eunoians to be actively involved in the community; and to build a strong sense of responsibility and willingness in them to contribute to the pursuit of the common good for the community and nation.
