 <center><h4><em>“The humanities put to the test what it means to be<br>fully human; they teach us, incrementally, endlessly,<br>not what to do but how to be.” <br><b>Mark Slouka</b></em></h4></center>

The EJC Humanities Programme grooms thought leaders and change makers with a sustained passion for the Humanities. We believe that our scholars have the propensity to create new knowledge and present new perspectives with a deep, multi-faceted view of the world. Our programme brings together ideas from East and West, immersing Humanities Scholars in the enduring school of Western thought and an Asian perspective of the Humanities. The opportunities we offer in the Humanities Programme build cultural intelligence, interdisciplinary know-how and metacognitive capacity. With that, the Humanities Scholar is able to step confidently into an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, thrive in the unfamiliar and embrace the intricacies of the human experience.

In our Humanities Scholarship Programme, you will have the world within reach. On your map are an overseas immersion trip, learning journeys, university-level seminars, the opportunity to delve into an area of interest and sharing it to your peers and a stimulating itinerary of enrichment activities. With unfamiliar lands and uncommon ideas to discover, get ready to travel far and wide.
