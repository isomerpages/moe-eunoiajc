The Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) nurtures principled, bi-literate and world-ready leaders who have a deep understanding of both Western and Chinese cultures. Spanning Year 3 to JC2, students undergo an intensive Chinese curriculum in China’s history, culture and contemporary developments, so that they are better able to engage with China. Students will be equipped to manage complexities and ambiguities in the relationship between East and West, and further Singapore’s interests with the world.

Students enrolled in the BSP will interact with students from other schools through the BSP Camp and BSP Symposium, as well as participate in overseas immersion programmes. You will have access to a resource room equipped with comprehensive research material and tools. With a pulse on the culture, history and economies in the East and West, you will be prepared for a cross-cultural future far beyond the classroom.
