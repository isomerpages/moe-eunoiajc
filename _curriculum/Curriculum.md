<h4><strong>Our 5i Curriculum</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Intrigue</strong></h5>
<p>Millions saw the apple fall but Newton asked why. We believe that curiosity
is more important than knowledge. Hence, our academic programme in <strong><a href="/subjects/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Knowledge Skills</a></strong>
<a href="/subjects/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">,</a><strong><a href="/subjects/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Languages</a></strong>
<a href="/subjects/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">,</a><strong><a href="/subjects/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Humanities and the Arts</a></strong>
<a href="/subjects/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">,</a><strong><a href="/subjects/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">and Mathematics and Sciences</a></strong> is
designed not simply to inform but to intrigue. Teaching and learning at
the college is supported by three pillars: educational neuroscience, educational
psychology and professional collaboration among teachers. Interesting lessons
are designed to develop our students’ cognitive and metacognitive abilities.
We believe that the greatest gift an education can provide is not great
knowledge but an undying thirst for knowledge. After all, the future belongs
to the curious.</p>
<h5><strong>Inspire</strong></h5>
<p>We want our students to inspire and be inspired. An inspired person finds
it easy to accomplish the difficult; an uninspired person finds it difficult
to even accomplish easy tasks.</p>
<p>Our flagship <strong><a href="/flagship-programmes/tdp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Talent Development Programme (GLIDE)</a></strong>,
supported by our <strong><a href="/special-programmes/bsp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese)</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/special-programmes/hsp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Humanities Scholarship and Programme</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/special-programmes/mep/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Music Elective Programme</a></strong>,
Programme <strong><a href="/special-programmes/altitude/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ALTITUDE</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/special-programmes/latitude/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LATITUDE</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/special-programmes/magnitude/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MAGNITUDE</a></strong>,
and the <strong><a href="/special-programmes/stem/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STEM Research Programme</a></strong>,
are platforms to inspire students to pursue their dreams, and opportunities
for them to be an inspiration to others in their pursuit of excellence.</p>
<h5><strong>Introspect</strong></h5>
<p>Our experiences are only as good as the lessons we draw from them through
quality introspection. Studies have shown that successful people have high
intrapersonal intelligence. High intrapersonal intelligence enables one
to discover one’s values, beliefs and passion. It also allows one to draw
the most valuable lessons from one’s experiences. We cultivate intrapersonal
intelligence in our students through meaningful introspection and by cultivating
their personal voice. Our <strong><a href="/flagship-programmes/lcp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Life Coaching Programme</a>, <a href="/student-development/leadership/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Leadership Academy</a>, <a href="/student-development/cce/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Character &amp; Citizenship Education</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/culture/cca/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Co-Curricular Activities</a></strong> are
designed to encourage and impart the important skill of introspection.</p>
<h5><strong>Invigorate</strong></h5>
<p>Passion is focussed energy. We want our students to be in love with life
and harness the power they get when they focus on what excites them. We
believe that an education is incomplete if students are not invigorated
or if they do not feel excited about what their future holds. Our students
will be energised through <strong><a href="/flagship-programmes/pp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Passion Pursuit</a>, <a href="/about/staff/pe/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Physical Education</a>, <a href="/culture/internships/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Internships and Externships</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/culture/aesthetics/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Aesthetics Programme</a></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Impact</strong></h5>
<p>Without making a contribution, great ambition and achievements are of
little significance — what is an educational experience without the opportunity
to make an impact? Students can look forward to exciting opportunities
to make an immediate impact, and learn how to continue making a difference
to our future. In our flagship <strong><a href="/flagship-programmes/wrp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">World Readiness&nbsp;Programme</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/special-programmes/csp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community Advocacy Programme</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/student-development/go/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Orientation Programme</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/student-development/via/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Values-in-Action</a></strong>,
they will build better communities, a better Singapore and a better world.</p>
