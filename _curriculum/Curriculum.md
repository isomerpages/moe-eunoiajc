#### **Our 5i Curriculum**


##### **Intrigue**

Millions saw the apple fall but Newton asked why. We believe that curiosity is more important than knowledge. Hence, our academic programme in [Knowledge Skills, Languages, Humanities and the Arts, and Mathematics and Sciences](/subjects/) is designed not simply to inform but to intrigue. Teaching and learning at the college is supported by three pillars: educational neuroscience, educational psychology and professional collaboration among teachers. Interesting lessons are designed to develop our students’ cognitive and metacognitive abilities. We believe that the greatest gift an education can provide is not great knowledge but an undying thirst for knowledge. After all, the future belongs to the curious.


##### **Inspire**

We want our students to inspire and be inspired. An inspired person finds it easy to accomplish the difficult; an uninspired person finds it difficult to even accomplish easy tasks. 

Our flagship [Talent Development Programme (GLIDE)](/flagship-programmes/tdp/), supported by our [Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese)](/special-programmes/bsp/), [Humanities Scholarship and Programme](/special-programmes/hsp/), [Music Elective Programme](/special-programmes/mep/), [Programme ALTITUDE](/special-programmes/altitude/), [LATITUDE](/special-programmes/latitude/) and [MAGNITUDE](/special-programmes/magnitude/), and the [STEM Research Programme](/special-programmes/stem/), are platforms to inspire students to pursue their dreams, and opportunities for them to be an inspiration to others in their pursuit of excellence. 


##### **Introspect**

Our experiences are only as good as the lessons we draw from them through quality introspection. Studies have shown that successful people have high intrapersonal intelligence. High intrapersonal intelligence enables one to discover one’s values, beliefs and passion. It also allows one to draw the most valuable lessons from one’s experiences. We cultivate intrapersonal intelligence in our students through meaningful introspection and by cultivating their personal voice. Our [Life Coaching Programme](/flagship-programmes/lcp/), [Leadership Academy](/student-development/leadership/), [Character & Citizenship Education](/student-development/cce/) and [Co-Curricular Activities](/culture/cca/) are designed to encourage and impart the important skill of introspection.


##### **Invigorate**

Passion is focussed energy. We want our students to be in love with life and harness the power they get when they focus on what excites them. We believe that an education is incomplete if students are not invigorated or if they do not feel excited about what their future holds. Our students will be energised through  [Passion Pursuit](/flagship-programmes/pp/), [Physical Education](/about/staff/pe/), [Internships and Externships](/culture/internships/) and [Aesthetics Programme](/culture/aesthetics/).


##### **Impact**

Without making a contribution, great ambition and achievements are of little significance — what is an educational experience without the opportunity to make an impact? Students can look forward to exciting opportunities to make an immediate impact, and learn how to continue making a difference to our future. In our flagship [World Readiness Programme](/flagship-programmes/wrp/), [Community Engagement Scholarship Programme](/special-programmes/csp/), [Global Orientation Programme](/student-development/go/), [Environmental Literacy Programme](/student-development/elp/) and [Values-in-Action](/student-development/via/), they will build better communities, a better Singapore and a better world.
