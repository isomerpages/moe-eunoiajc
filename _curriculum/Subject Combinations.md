### **Subject Combinations**

Our students undertake the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Curriculum, offering **10 to 12 units of study** including two Knowledge Skills subjects, Mother Tongue and four content-based subjects. Each H2 subject carries 2 academic units. H1 and H3 subjects carry 1 unit each.

For the academic course of 2023-24, the college is offering **39 Arts combinations and 41 Science combinations**, including 'hybrid' options.

The [**EJC Subject Combination Proposal Exercise (SCOPE)**](/files/EJC-SCOPE-2023.pdf) information booklet can be downloaded in [**PDF**](/files/EJC-SCOPE-2023.pdf) format.



###### **JOINT ADMISSIONS EXERCISE**

###### **PREFERRED COMBINATIONS**
All students may propose their **preferred subject combination** if it is not featured in the list of subject combinations, subject to approval.

###### **HYBRID COMBINATIONS**

Students intending to offer 2 Mathematics and Sciences subjects and 2 Humanities and the Arts subjects may refer to page 7 of the **[information booklet.](/files/EJC-SCOPE-2023.pdf)** The college offers 12 ‘hybrid’ subject combinations in the **Science** stream: S4-1 to S4-6, and S5-1 to S5-6.

###### **MERIT-BASED ALLOCATION**

Students intending to offer [H2 Art](/academic-subjects/Humanties-and-the-Arts/art/), [H2 Further Mathematics](/academic-subjects/Mathematics-and-Sciences/futher-mathematics/), [H2 Knowledge & Inquiry](/academic-subjects/Knowledge-Skills/knowledge-and-inquiry/), [H2 Music](/academic-subjects/Humanties-and-the-Arts/music/) or [H2 Translation (Chinese)](/academic-subjects/Humanties-and-the-Arts/translation-chinese/) must pass a selection test/audition administered by the college.

The indicative cut-off point for [H2 Biology](/subjects/bio/), [H2 Chemistry](/subjects/chem/) and [H2 Physics](/subjects/phy/) is B3 for the respective subject at the GCE O-Level Examination or equivalent, or A1 for Combined Science at the GCE O-Level Examination.

The indicative cut-off point for [H2 Further Mathematics](/subjects/fmaths/) is A1 for Additional Mathematics at the GCE O-Level Examination or equivalent.

###### **H3 SUBJECTS**

Designed for outstanding students, H3 subjects are offered in **JC2** together with the stipulated subject at H2 level. Students will be informed of the application process and eligibility criteria in JC1.

###### **SPECIAL PROGRAMMES**

If a subject is oversubscribed, students will be selected based on academic merit.

###### **UNIVERSITY COURSE PRE-REQUISITES**

Your future career may require you to undertake certain degrees and/or courses at the undergraduate level. In turn, these undergraduate courses in the universities may or may not have course-specific subject pre-requisites. As such, you are advised to check the minimum requirements on the university websites directly before making a decision on the subject combination to offer.
