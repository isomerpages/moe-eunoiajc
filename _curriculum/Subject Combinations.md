<h6><strong>UNIVERSITY COURSE PRE-REQUISITES</strong></h6>

courses at the&nbsp;undergraduate level. In turn, these undergraduate courses
in the universities may or may not have course-specific subject pre-requisites.
As such, you are advised to check the minimum requirements on the university
websites directly before making a decision on the subject combination to
offer.</p>
<h6><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</strong></h6>
<p>In the event that there is insufficient student subscription in a particular
subject or subject combination, the college reserves the right not to offer
that subject or subject combination.</p>
