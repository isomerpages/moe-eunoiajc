### **Subject Combinations**

All our students undertake the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Curriculum, offering **10 to 12 units of study** including **[H1 General Paper](/academic-subjects/Knowledge-Skills/general-paper/)**, **[H1 Mother Tongue](/academic-subjects/Languages/mother-tongue-languages/)** and four content-based subjects. Each H2 subject carries 2 academic units. H1 and H3 subjects carry 1 unit each.

Students admitted via the **Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE)** must propose subject combinations in the stream (Arts or Science) to which they are posted. 

The **[EJC Subject Combination Proposal Exercise (SCOPE)](/files/EJC_SCOPE_2024.pdf)** information booklet can be downloaded in **[PDF](/files/EJC_SCOPE_2024.pdf)** format. All students may propose their **preferred subject combination** if it is not featured in the list of subject combinations, subject to approval.

###### **KNOWLEDGE SKILLS**
All students offer **[H1 General Paper](/subjects/gp/)**. In their first year, students must offer **[H1 Project Work](/subjects/pw/)**.


###### **LANGUAGES**

**[French](/subjects/fl/)**, **[German](/subjects/fl/)**, **[Japanese](/subjects/fl/)** or **[Spanish](/subjects/fl/)** can be offered as an H2 subject for Arts students and a contrasting H2 subject for Science students. These subjects are offered at the Ministry of Education Language Centre (MOELC).


###### **HYBRID COMBINATIONS**
Students intending to offer 2 Mathematics and Sciences subjects and 2 Humanities and the Arts subjects may refer to page 7 of the **[information booklet](/files/EJC_SCOPE_2024.pdf)**. The college offers 12 ‘hybrid’ subject combinations in the **Science** stream: S4-1 to S4-6, and S5-1 to S5-6.


###### **CONTRASTING SUBJECT**
Students must offer a contrasting subject as one of the four content-based subjects.
- **Science** students must offer at least one subject from the Humanities and the Arts group.
- **Arts** students offer **[H1 or H2 Mathematics](/subjects/maths/)** as their contrasting subject.
- **[H2 Knowledge and Inquiry](/subjects/ki/)** is considered a contrasting subject for Science and Arts students, and offered as the fourth H2 subject.


###### **SUBJECT RE-OPTIMISATION**
Students offering 4 H2 content-based subjects may re-optimise one H2 content-based subject to H1 Level at appropriate points in the course.


###### **H3 SUBJECTS**
Designed for outstanding students, H3 subjects are offered in **JC2** together with the stipulated subject at H2 level. Students will be informed of the application process and eligibility criteria in JC1.


###### **MERIT-BASED ALLOCATION**
Students intending to offer **[H2 Art](/subjects/art/)**, **[H2 Further Mathematics](/subjects/fmaths/)**, **[H2 Knowledge & Inquiry](/subjects/ki/)**, **[H2 Music](/subjects/music/)** or **[H2 Translation (Chinese)](/subjects/translation/)** must pass a selection test/audition administered by the college.

Students intending to offer **[H2 Translation (Chinese)](/subjects/translation/)** must have obtained a minimum of **A2** for English Language and **B3** for Higher Chinese or **A2** for Chinese at the GCE O-Level Examination, based on centrally-stated prerequisites.

Students intending to offer **[French, German, Japanese or Spanish](/subjects/fl/)** at H2 or H1 Level must have studied the respective language at MOELC in Secondary 4 or Year 4 prior to joining the college.

If a subject is oversubscribed, students will be selected based on academic merit, including (i) L1R5 aggregate score or equivalent, excluding bonus points, and (ii) performance in the relevant subject(s).

The indicative cut-off point for **[H2 Biology](/subjects/bio/), [H2 Chemistry](/subjects/chem/) and [H2 Physics](/subjects/phy/)** is **B3** for the respective subject at the GCE O-Level Examination or equivalent, or **A1** for Combined Science at the GCE O-Level Examination.

The indicative cut-off point for **[H2 Further Mathematics](/subjects/fmaths/)** is **A1** for Additional Mathematics at the GCE O-Level Examination or equivalent.


###### **SPECIAL PROGRAMMES**
**[Bicultural Studies Programme](/special-programmes/bsp/)** [BSP(C)] scholars must offer **[H2 China Studies in Chinese](subjects/csc/)**.

###### **UNIVERSITY COURSE PRE-REQUISITES**
Your future career may require you to undertake certain degrees and/or courses at the undergraduate level. In turn, these undergraduate courses in the universities may or may not have course-specific subject pre-requisites. As such, you are advised to check the minimum requirements on the university websites directly before making a decision on the subject combination to offer.


###### **OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**
In the event that there is insufficient student subscription in a particular subject or subject combination, the college reserves the right not to offer that subject or subject combination.
