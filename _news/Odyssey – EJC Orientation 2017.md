To welcome its first-ever Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) cohort and strengthen the Eunoia family, the college embarked on an Odyssey - EJC Orientation 2017. The theme would be a fitting one for a pioneering group of Eunoians who would live an epic journey from 3 Feb to 10 Feb, and go on to shape the college's legacy in the next two pivotal years.

Our Eunoians were certainly excited to welcome their new peers from a total of 45 secondary schools into their midst, engaging them in games and bonding activities on Matriculation Day. First days always bring with them a fair share of nerves; while their new friends attended important briefings, students from the Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) prepared personalised welcome cards to every JAE student in their Orientation Group and presented them. As if this did not rouse enough emotion for a first day, our Orientation Leaders set the stage for an even more eventful Orientation Week by relaunching the college mass dance - now with newer, more creative dance moves. This brought Matriculation Day to a close.

In the next two days of Orientation, our new Eunoians got closer within their Houses and found time to engage the community. Each OG ventured either to Holland Drive or to Ghim Moh market to complete a series of activities meticulously planned by the Community Mapping committee. Amongst them was the chance to _bai nian_, with small groups of students presenting mandarin oranges and bright smiles to stall holders at the two markets. Our students of course did not miss the opportunity to tuck into the famously delicious dishes at both food centres.

A Sports Fiesta, dance practices, a War Games segment and more fun-filled games would be the order of the next few days. The Orientation Groups were re-sorted into classes, but the spirit of our Eunoians was still evident to anyone who saw them cheer for their new houses or compete with their classmates.

The finale on 10 Feb 2017 could only be more spectacular. Once Deputy Principals Mr Boy Eng Seng and Mr Poh Chun Leck set the campfire ablaze, our students sang, danced and got embroiled in our very own Eulympics until nightfall. In one last hurrah, Eunoians got in on another first - a mass dance party that culminated in the college dance. With the moon shining on Eunoia that night, our Eunoians duly returned the favour by shining too.
