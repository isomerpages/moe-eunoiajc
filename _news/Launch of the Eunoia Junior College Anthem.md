On 6 Feb 2017, we launched our College Anthem to formally welcome students from the Joint Admissions Exercise into the Eunoia family.

The anthem was co-created by a team of student-volunteers from our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools and staff from the college. The year-long process started in 2016 and was led by our teachers Mr Lionel Lye, Mr Benjamin Liang and Mrs Kellie Woo, who guided students and teachers through ideation, composition, and the writing of lyrics that would ultimately represent the college's vision, mission and values.

At the morning assembly programme, Mr Benjamin Liang and Mr Lionel Lye shared with our newly inducted JC1 Eunoians on the process and the meaning of the lyrics. Two of our Eunoians, Nigel Goh and Jelita Jaimon, then joined voices with Mr Lionel Lye and the rest of the pioneer cohort to sing the College Anthem. Our Eunoians will have an opportunity to make themselves heard, literally and figuratively, in the near future: a full recording of the anthem will be produced for many generations of Eunoians to sing and and hold close to their hearts.

Deputy Principal Mr Poh Chun Leck said: “The college anthem represents our collective aspirations for our pioneer batch of Eunoians, and all future batches who will walk through our gates. What’s most admirable about it was how it came about – a co-creation process by aspiring Eunoians who stepped out of their comfort zone to bring us a great step forward. This is definitely a piece of music that we are proud of as a Eunoia family – a song of purpose, a melody from the heart, a tune that will encourage us to face the future with courage.”

### Our College Anthem

_Verse_

Beginning with a dream  
Making history  
As one we write  
Our destiny  
Eunoia’s legacy

With passion every day  
We strive and light the way  
Our hearts unite  
Our minds ignite  
Our dreams take flight

_Chorus_

Beautiful thinking  
Bridging heart and mind  
Eunoia shining  
Our glories we define

Goodwill to others  
Friendships forevermore  
With purpose, heart and courage strong  
Eunoia’s voices soar  
With purpose, heart and courage strong  
Eunoia  
Our voices soar!
