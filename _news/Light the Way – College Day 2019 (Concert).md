> College Day 2019  
> 11 May 2019

Eunoia Junior College celebrated her third College Day on 11 May 2019 with a landmark first — a fundraising concert featuring the combined talent of its five aesthetic groups, Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Dance, Drama and Symphonic Band. Over two hundred student performers took to the stage at the University Cultural Centre (UCC) Hall, a culmination of months of rehearsals, coordination and conceptualisation. Joining them were our JC1 Eunoians from three special interest groups, Street Dance, String Ensemble and the Ghim Moh Rock Band, who excited and delighted the crowd with a pre-concert performance at the UCC Foyer.

Lighting the way throughout the evening were EJC Drama. They brought _Project Mooncake_ to the performance table, entertaining the audience with a story of five tribes at odds with each other in their search for treasure while weaving the various performances together. EJC Chinese Orchestra, Symphonic Band and Choir added drama of their own with their set and choice pieces from their recent Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. Further vivifying their music and the story of _Project Mooncake,_ unique 'dynamic stills' were created by a team of students from EJC Media in collaboration with art teacher Ms Ang Siew Ching. The evening was brought to a rapturous close by EJC Dance, joined on stage by instructor Mr Dan Kwoh, and teachers-in-charge Ms Sandra Chan, Ms Tan Fangxi and Mdm Tan Lingmin.

Funds raised from the concert will be used to furnish the air-conditioned hall at the college's Bishan campus. The college would like to thank all sponsors and audience members who joined us for a glowing night of music and art.
