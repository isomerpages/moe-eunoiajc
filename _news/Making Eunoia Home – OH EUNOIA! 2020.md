###### REPORTING BY EJC PRESS

Having started 2020 with our Big Move from Mount Sinai, we held our first Open House here at our Bishan campus, inviting prospective students to Make Eunoia Home. Our visitors were greeted warmly upon their arrival at the Auditorium, the first stop in an exciting campus tour led by the EJC Student Ambassadors. From the 900-seat Auditorium where lectures and concerts are held, to the Stadium which features the first elevated track and field in Singapore, the campus tour showed our visitors the beautiful place we call home.

At the last stop of the campus tour, our visitors entered the Library, where they were not just greeted with a scenic panorama of the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, but also welcomed by our friendly alumni volunteers. Our alumni shared their academic experiences and engaged curious students and parents who wanted to find out more about the various subjects we offer, such as China Studies in Chinese (CSC) and Knowledge and Inquiry (KI). Subject tutors also addressed any queries posed regarding subject combinations and their teaching and learning philosophy. In addition, various taster lessons scheduled throughout the day at the Seminar Rooms and Science Laboratories allowed visitors to experience Eunoia's concept-based pedagogy for themselves.

The Learning Rooms and Student Lounge featured our Special Programmes showcase. Our students presented their learning experiences in programmes such as the Eunoia Global Orientation Programme (Eunoia GO), which aims to nurture informed and responsible global citizens through cultural immersion trips to various countries, and Programme Latitude, which aims to cultivate intellectual humility and moral responsibility in students through interdisciplinary modules that enrich and broaden their worldview.

At Symposia, our visitors stepped into a bustling hub of student activity, with various CCA booths helmed by enthusiastic students in their CCA and House shirts. Besides admiring the meticulously curated articles and artwork displayed at the EJC Press and EJC Visual Arts booths, visitors were also invited to try their hand at photography with different cameras at the Media Club booth. While students from our Sports CCAs engaged enthusiastic participants who were up for a game, the Aesthetics showcase featuring our Performing Arts CCAs regaled the crowd with song, dance and drama, and in the boisterous display of the five Houses’ dances and cheers, our college’s vibrant student culture certainly shone through.

It is with pride that we settled in our new home, and we hope OH EUNOIA! 2020 inspired you to make Eunoia your home too!
