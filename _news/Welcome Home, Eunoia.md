The college has moved to Mount Sinai. On the 5th of October, the Eunoia staff moved out from our temporary office at the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL) and crossed the road to our rejuvenated campus.

It was an eventful day with its share of adieus and salutations. Before we left for Mount Sinai, our Principal, Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng, thanked the Executive Director and staff of SCCL with a token of appreciation for their warm hospitality during our nine-month stay. Shortly after, she would be joined by Mr Robin Soh, the first teacher to join us, Mrs Brigitte Koh, our first Head of Department and Ms Ng Koh Yee, our Administration Manager, in a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the gate of Mount Sinai. There was all the more reason to cheer as Mrs Wong, Mrs Koh and Ms Ng have been preparing for the day since 2015. To further mark the occasion, the college had the pleasure of welcoming school leaders from our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools.

In the coming weeks, we will be expecting more members of the college community to join us — our 2017 staff and their family members, and on 20 Oct, our very first cohort of Eunoians. We look forward to seeing you soon at our new campus at **53 Mount Sinai Road, Singapore 276880**.
