The college’s first-ever Unconference Day on 5 Jul 2017 was a day of learning, exploration and discovery. Eunoians had the chance to try something they always wanted but never did, and the opportunity to share their expertise and passion as facilitators.

Our students co-created the Unconference Day programme by starting a GoogleDoc to propose sessions, volunteer to run sessions, and vote for the sessions they wish to attend. Ms Adrienne de Souza, HOD (Project Work & Flagship Programmes), said, “Anyone can run a session on Unconference Day. We wanted to overturn the traditional ‘teacher teaches, students participate’ model, and to give our students the voice to express themselves and pursue their interests.”

Unconference Day saw a total of 34 unique activities run by the Eunoia community, guest speakers and trainers. Principal Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng conducted three floral jamming sessions, which proved overwhelmingly popular amongst students. Other staff members also lent their heads, hearts and hands. Mr Edson Ng led a film workshop comparing Hollywood animation with Japanese anime, Mr Jeffrey Ha ran and swam with a group of aspiring biathletes, Mr Peter Gn made K-pop dancing look a breeze, and Mdm Chen Lili shared the art of tea appreciation across two full sessions. There were surprises too. Mr Jonathan Chong incorporated a science lesson into the making of huge magic bubbles. Mr Victor Yang maintained a fine balancing act teaching students how to juggle. Other highlights included a fiction writing workshop by Yu-Mei Balasingam Chow, an ice-skating experience at a nearby rink, an aerial dance class by aerial fitness instructors and a serious sampling of yoga.

The stars of Unconference Day were our Eunoians. Lim Zhineng (17-U3), Lam Ka Yi and Kwek Xiu Qi (both 17-I4) coaxed smooth moves from participants in their hip-hop session, while Ally Ong (17-O2) learned new skills so that she could run a tabletop role-playing game for the first time. Makers in the Eunoia student body came out in full force. Leong Wen Li and Weng Pei Yun (both 17-E2) taught their peers about typography and calligraphy. Lim Li Wen (17-E4) shared her passion making crochet keychains, while Dody Senputra (17-E4), Jackson Tiong (17-U4) and Javin Eng (17-A4) from the EJC Robotics Club led a coding workshop. On the enthusiastic response from student-facilitators, Ms de Souza said, “I hope that even more students will come forward to hold sessions in future now that they have seen how passionate their peers are and how rewarding it can be to share their interests with others.”

As part of the Passion Pursuit programme, Eunoians also heard from guest speakers such as Teo Sin Ee, who shined light on her experience working with the marginalised working class in Taiwan. U. K. Shyam, educator and national record holder for the 100m sprint, spoke about the challenges and triumphs on his sporting journeying and also held a special speed clinic for Eunoians. On the experience, Allison Hoe (17-O1) reflected, “Unconference Day was an enriching experience for me. I feel blessed to hear the talk and attend the speed clinic by U. K. Shyam. I can relate to and am inspired by \[Shyam’s\] setbacks and failures on his track and field journey... and how he was able to maintain his passion. Going after your dreams is not easy, but it’s worth it.”
