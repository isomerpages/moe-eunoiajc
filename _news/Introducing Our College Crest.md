A crest is more than a beautiful symbol. It tells the story of a school, about how it came to be, its distinctive qualities and most importantly, its vision, mission and values. Having co-created the college ethos with our Joint Integrated Programme students and stakeholders in 2015, we began to conceptualise the crest in early 2016.

## Research

As a new school, we sought a modern and versatile design that would represent our role as an educational institution. The iconography would also signify our aspirations for every Eunoian to be a Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage.

We naturally began our research by revisiting the college name, Eunoia. We thought about the beauty of life, learning and giving that ‘Beautiful Thinking’ and ‘Goodwill to All’ stand for. At the same time, we reflected on our role as educators who seek to develop the whole person – the minds and hearts of our students. Eunoians would be inspired to live passionately and purposefully, balancing work and play.

## Design

The college team conducted an extensive study of school crests, starting from the local pre-university landscape and reaching out to overseas universities, and modern corporate logos. We gathered designs that inspired us, assembled a design brief and collaborated with local designer [**Kevin He**](https://www.behance.net/kevinhe) of Kong Studio, whose work showed the ingenuity and cultural sensibility we were looking for. Collectively, we worked towards a crest that would complement the circular appearance and modern tone of the college wordmark.

In June and July 2016, the crest was presented to Ministry of Education, Joint Integrated Programme school Principals, School Advisory Boards, and executive committee members of alumni associations, who helped to steer the final design.

## The Crest

The Eunoia Junior College Crest can be understood by three qualities, or simply A-B-C : All-round Development, Beautiful Thinking and Cultural Conversance.

**All-round Development**  
The circular shape of the crest signifies the holistic development of Eunoians.

This roundedness is complemented by the geometry of the college wordmark and typeface.

**Beautiful Thinking**  
The design of the crest is inspired by the neural networks of  
the human brain, and signifies beautiful thinking.

**Cultural Conversance**  
The design represents the college’s name Eunoia, an English word, with an Asian theme.

Eunoians are able to thrive in diverse cultural settings,  
while remaining rooted to their own culture.

## Response

We had the opportunity to unveil the crest to our JIP students from Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School. Here are some of their thoughts on the crest.

> “I like the meaning behind the college crest, as it really represents the college vision. I really like the simple nature of it and also because it has a modern take to it. As a new JC, a new, modern symbol would be very representative of us and a new beginning.”

**Angelique Chia

> “I like the minimalist design of our college crest. I also like how the college crest represents not just one thing, but represents multiple messages, and it brings out \[…\] beautiful thinking. I think it really makes us unique.”

**Marisa Lim**  
CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School

> “I like that it has a very unique design (and that) it is in the shape of a circle, which reminds me of being united, being all-rounded.”
