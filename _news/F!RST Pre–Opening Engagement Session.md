### F!RST of Many Historic Firsts

The publication of Shakespeare’s First Folio. The discovery of the world’s first vaccine. The advent of the World Wide Web. Singapore’s first Olympic Gold medal. The construction of the first HDB new town. The building of Singapore’s newest junior college.

As the first cohort of Eunoians, you are part of history and the making of many more historic firsts. You and your parents are invited to the inaugural gathering of Eunoians for a glimpse into the first pages of the Eunoia story. You are the F!RST. The first to create a legacy for generations of Eunoians to come, and maybe, the architect of many more historic firsts.

### Time to Explore Tomorrow

At this inaugural gathering of Eunoians, a medley of activities has been prepared to mark the occasion. We hope that these will create precious memories for our students and the college. Looking further ahead, we would like to share more about the vibrant orientation programmes, leadership opportunities and scholarships that await our Eunoians.

Anticipating the interest in our academic curriculum, our staff have prepared a special preview of teaching and learning in Eunoia. Students and parents are invited to attend concurrent lessons on subjects such as General Paper, Project Work, Economics, Physics, and Mathematics. Not only will these lessons introduce the academic depth and rigour at ‘A’ Level, they promise to engage and excite you about the Eunoia classroom experience.

\*Function Rooms 1 and 2 can accommodate up to 50 participants each. Places are available on a first-come-first-served basis.

Information booths, a brunch reception and other engaging activities will also take place from 10 am to 12 noon.

This experience would not be complete without the partnership of parents. At the session, we will be inviting parents of our Year 4 JIP students to join us in creating a meaningful, transformative journey for our Eunoians.
