The first ever EJC Road Run was held at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park II, near the site of its permanent Bishan campus on 19 May 2017. Students and staff soaked in the morning sun on a 3.6km route, seeking to raise funds for student scholarships and financial assistance, as well as infrastructural improvements to its existing Mount Sinai campus. There was plenty reason to cheer, even more so for the eventual champion house, Ora.

EJC Road Run 2017 was organised by sports representatives from the five houses, and their passion guided much of the run's success. Support also came from Parents@Eunoia, who were at Bishan to give out 700 bananas to thankful student and staff runners.
