The college congratulates Ms Kok Li-en on receiving the Inspiring Teacher of English Award (ITEA) 2019 from Guest of Honour Ms Low Yen Ling, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Manpower, at a ceremony on 8 Oct 2019.

Ms Kok was one of nine educators to receive the award, which acknowledges teachers who ignite a love for the English language and are effective in helping their students speak and write accurately.

She joins the ranks of the other ITEA holders since its inception in 2008, including Ms Chia Hui Ping (2012), Mr Marc Kenji Lim (2015) and Ms Bernice Yeo who received the college's first award in 2018.

On receiving the award, Ms Kok shared:

> "I’m deeply humbled to receive an award that I’m frankly still uncomfortable associating myself with. If anything, I hope this award will speak about how the Eunoia English department has been an amazing, nurturing and dynamic team that has allowed me to grow and develop as an educator. And of course I want to dedicate this award to my wonderful students whom I have truly enjoyed teaching tremendously – you have brought me more joy than you know (I tend not to show it), and provided me with ample opportunities for growth and learning (try to infer what this means). Hopefully in due time you will realise that nothing you’ve learnt in GP is merely academic – it is life itself!"

In their nominations, Ms Kok's students shared how she inspires them in the Eunoia General Paper classroom:

> "I think Ms Kok is more than deserving of the Inspiring Teacher Award because of her passion for teaching the subject. From the very first day I stepped into her class, I knew that I was in good hands simply because she made me feel like I could gradually like GP as a subject even though it was definitely not one of my favourite subjects."

> "Ms Kok genuinely cares for her students and she always puts a lot of effort into her lessons to ensure that her students get good resources, imparting new knowledge to us whenever possible. She has a genuine passion for the subject and as her students, we can genuinely feel that she loves the subject that she teaches and the things that she does. As such, I feel that Ms Kok definitely deserves this award."
