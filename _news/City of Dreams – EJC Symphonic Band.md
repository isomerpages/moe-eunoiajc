The Eunoia Junior College Symphonic Band held its first public performance at the Singapore Botanic Gardens on 6 Aug 2017, in collaboration with the concert bands from JIP partner schools Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School and Singapore Chinese Girls' School.

This landmark occasion was to be a special one that celebrated the nation's 52nd birthday, as well as the first mass gathering of students, alumni and families from all four JIP schools. In addition to playing crowd favourites, the four bands played up the nostalgia with songs like 'Kopi-O', 'Where I Belong' and 'Home'.
