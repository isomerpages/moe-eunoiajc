### Beautiful Thinking  
Goodwill to All

The Eunoia family and I warmly welcome you. Thank you for joining us at the Official Opening of Eunoia Junior College. It is our privilege to be here with current and past principals from our Joint Integrated Programme, the chairpersons of our JIP school boards, and our stakeholders from the Ministry of Education, alumni associations, parent-groups and colleagues from schools. 

Eunoia stands for beautiful thinking, goodwill to all. Your beautiful thinking and goodwill has made Eunoia possible. You dreamed with us, stood with us and supported us every step of the way. We are beautiful because of you. On behalf of the Eunoia family, thank you. 

### Purpose, Heart and  
Courage Strong

With your support, the young adults entrusted to us will become thinkers and leaders with a deep sense of purpose, empathy for others and the courage to stand up for what is right.

Purpose, heart and courage are the foundation of all that we do. In our Official Opening, you will experience what learning is like in Eunoia with our Unconference sessions. Right here in our Human Library, you will hear stories of our heritage from students, staff, parents and school leaders.

### As One We Write  
Eunoia Junior College

In the past one and a half years, our students have given us great cause for joy with their achievements in various domains. They have shaped a college culture, built house identities and implemented innumerable initiatives of their creation. Because of their efforts, Eunoia today is a college we are proud of.

The theme of our official opening, _As One We Write_, is an incomplete sentence. Our students will write their unique stories and experiences to complete our narrative of beautiful thinking, goodwill to all.

Eunoia is not a single story. Our birth is the story of three schools with a shared dream. Our legacy is formed by the stories of many Eunoians who will make their mark on Singapore and the world.

Enjoy today as we tell the story of Eunoia. As we press on to write the future of the college, may each of us, too, be inspired to continue writing the future of our country in our unique ways. Thank you.
