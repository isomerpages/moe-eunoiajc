In a rousing finale to the year, the cohort of 2017 embarked on an Amazing Race around our island-city that culminated at Tanjong Beach, Sentosa on 17 Nov.

This special one-day event organised by the EJC Student Council was flagged off by Deputy Principal Mr Poh Chun Leck. Eunoians had the opportunity to soak in the sights of Singapore, starting from our homely Ghim Moh neighbourhood to Tiong Bahru and other historic sites such as the National Gallery (the former City Hall and Supreme Court) and The Majestic. Learning was gained as sweat was lost, after many quizzes, wefies and recitations of Romeo and Juliet.

All the groups would eventually converge at their final station in Sentosa, where they would later gather for a picnic and games with their Civics Group. The highlight of the day was to be a 'rave' led by our resident DJ Ong Seeu Sim (17-I4), who got Eunoians up and off on their feet for a shining hour.

Euphoria was the word of the day and the night. Euphoric was the year spent as the first Eunoians, and perhaps the year ahead of us too.
