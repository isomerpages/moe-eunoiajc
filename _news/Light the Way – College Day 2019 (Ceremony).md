> College Day 2019  
> 11 May 2019

Eunoia Junior College celebrated its third college day with a ceremony and fundraising concert held at the University Cultural Centre, National University of Singapore on 11 May 2019. Under the theme Light the Way, the afternoon segment recognised the achievements of both its first class, on the back of their stellar A-Level results and contributions to the college, and Eunoians in their second year at the college. Fittingly, a group of alumni dancers illuminated the stage with a performance to the tune of 'Everglow'.

The ceremony was graced by Guest-of-Honour Mr Christopher de Souza, Advisor to the Ulu Pandan Grassroots Organisation. In his address, Mr de Souza spoke about the holistic programmes that Eunoians have benefitted from and the contributions in service and in spirit to the Ghim Moh community during their time at the Mount Sinai campus. In appreciation of the partnership between Ulu Pandan and the college, Principal Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng presented Mr de Souza with a handmade scrapbook of Eunoians' memories of the people and places.

Over a hundred Eunoians from the college's graduating class of 2018 received awards for their holistic and academic achievements. Amongst these were subject book prizes and commendation awards, best progress awards, as well as Visionary and Pinnacle awards that recognise outstanding Eunoians who have demonstrated exemplary qualities and embodied the vision and values of the college. Having aided our Eunoians' development in character and intellect, several of our partners including the pioneering members of Parents@Eunoia were recognised with the Partners Appreciation Award.

The college would like to extend its deepest appreciation to Professor Su Guaning, Dr Ruth Kam, Bishan North Community Centre, all three alumni associations of our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools, Mr Wong Liang Tang, Professor Henry Yeung, Parents@Eunoia and the NUS Department of Philosophy for generously contributing to the book prizes and awards for our Eunoians.
