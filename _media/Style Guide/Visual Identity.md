The Eunoia Junior College Visual Identity embodies the college's vision, mission, and values. The college crest, wordmark and combination marks are used to represent beautiful thinking, all-round development and cultural conversance in multiple environments and styles. This guide details the uses of the different logos.

College-appointed vendors and students should approach their Eunoia Junior College staff liaison for the Illustrator or high-resolution files for the purpose of production. Do not use or reproduce the identity elements featured on this page.

### Crest

The Eunoia crest is the principal symbol of the college. The primary crest is applied in typical settings in Eunoia Blue. The secondary crest is applied in circular environments such as the college collar pin, badges, and social media profile images.

The Eunoia crest should be used with optimal readability and visibility in mind. The crest may also be used in combination with the wordmark, as seen in the combination marks below.
