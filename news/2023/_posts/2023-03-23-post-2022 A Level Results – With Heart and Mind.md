Eunoia Junior College congratulates our class of 2022 for their well-deserved achievement at the 2022 Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Examination. Enduring and thriving in two years of constant change, the class of 2022 have shown character, heart and mind throughout their Eunoia journey.

The college is proud of all 658 Eunoians who sat the 2022 GCE A-Level Examination. The cohort achieved a median University Admission Score (UAS) of 85 rank points and a mean UAS of 82.2 rank points. About 5 in 10 students garnered 85 rank points or more. 4 in 10 Eunoians scored at least 3 H2 distinctions, with 2 in 10 Eunoians attaining 6 distinctions or more.

Ms Yang Shu Hung, Dean for the Class of 2022, said, 'The Class of 2022 has demonstrated great resilience and adaptability, adjusting to external circumstances quickly and remaining purposeful throughout their 2 years in EJC. I am privileged to be able to journey with this batch of remarkable Eunoians, and I am confident that they will continue to shine in their next stage of life.'  

Principal of Eunoia Junior College, Mr Andrew Tan said, 'The Class of 2022 is our fifth cohort of graduates. You have done us proud and done very well indeed. Not only have you gone far in a brief two years, you have gone far because we have gone together. We knew you would do well before today because we have journeyed with you, supported you, and witnessed your effort, resilience, and spirit first-hand.

Your achievements as a cohort have been mind-blowing. You are the cohort that led us as we emerged from COVID-19, whether it was organising an Orientation to behold in 2022 with restrictions still in force, creating the colour and joy of Humanities and Aesthetics Week or assembling many programmes from scratch as we tried to make the most of our opportunities. It was wonderful to see our auditorium, studios and outdoor spaces filled with so much life! There were also the games where our athletes played their hardest and the cheer support that gave us the push towards victory or holding the line against strong opponents. You engaged with societal issues and made a difference through various programmes like DDD or LAM. You learned from thought leaders, heard their perspectives, shared your views and served the community in CCA-based VIA and GLIDE. This you have all done well.

Then there was 14 October last year, a culmination of your time here in EJ. As I watched you celebrate the Eunoia spirit together one last time as Eunoians, I was reminded that there is something special here. Amazing things have happened with you. Amazing things will continue to happen for you.

Regardless of whether you have done as well as you had expected or not quite what you had hoped for, our heartiest congratulations for having crossed this milestone! Know that you have made an achievement no less deserving of congratulations and admiration. Regardless of the score, celebrate, take stock, go together, go far.'

The growth and achievements of our Eunoians would not be possible without the dedication and support of teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, College Advisory Committee and Joint Integrated Programme partner schools. To the Class of 2022, as Eunoians evermore, may you grow in purpose, heart and courage as you let your dreams take flight.
