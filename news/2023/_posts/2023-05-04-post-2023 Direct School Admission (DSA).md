The Direct School Admission (DSA-JC) provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a Junior College (JC), based on a diverse range of academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the GCE ‘O’ Level examination. It is an annual exercise that takes place from May to August.

The 2023 Direct School Admission (DSA-JC) exercise opens on 3 May 2023. Interested students should fill in the [online application form](https://form.gov.sg/6451f961c7e8e30012db26cf) which must reach us by 25 June 2023*.

*Note: For all applicants to note:
1. Attach 2 sets of the latest official results slips from the school, 1 set of results from Secondary 3 and 1 set of results from Secondary 4. 
(Any official progress report from the school during Secondary 3 and Secondary 4. Could be weighted Assessment, Mid-Year Examinations and End of Year Examinations, if any.)

For more information on the DSA-JC application process and the specific categories, please visit our 2023 Direct School Admission Exercise page.

Eligibility
The DSA-JC exercise allows all Secondary 4 students with special talents and achievements to apply to Eunoia Junior College directly.

Successful applicants are guaranteed a place in the college, provided they meet eligibility criteria for admission to a JC after the release of their Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level results. 
- Successful DSA-JC students will NOT be allowed to take part in the Joint Admissions Exercise as places have already been reserved for them in the DSA-JC schools.

They are expected to honour their commitment to the posted DSA-JC schools and to participate in activities related to the talent selected in, for the duration of the programme admitted to.
