Dear Parents,

**Internship & Externship Programme**

To help Eunoians gain exposure and insight into industries of their interest, the Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education (CSH) Committee is working to provide them with internship and externship opportunities. We hope that such experiences will allow our students in JC1 and our incoming students from our Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) schools to gain a better understanding of themselves andÂ make informed choices for their future courses of study and careers.

We hope to provide the following internship and externship opportunities to our students:

If you or your organisation are keen to partner us to provide such opportunities to our current and future Eunoians, please email **Mr Peter Soh** at [peter.soh@ejc.edu.sg](mailto:peter.soh@ejc.edu.sg) with the following details by **22 Jun 2023**:

* Number of students you can cater to;
* Time Period and Duration; and
* A brief description of what the student(s) will be involved in.

If you would like to share with us other potential partners keen to host internships or externships for our students, we would welcome your response too.

We hope to hear from you soon. Thank you!
