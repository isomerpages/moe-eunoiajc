### Isabelle Deborah Looi

**Isabelle Deborah Looi Yan Yi (21-E3)** was an alumna of SNGS who truly excelled holistically. Apart from being President of the Debate Society, she was also part of GLIDE, a regular volunteer at Meet the People sessions and a H3 History student. She has been offered the PSC (Legal Service) scholarship in recognition of her outstanding intellect and her commitment to using her talents to benefit others.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?
I’m largely satisfied with my results! Since I believe that results are simply a means to an end, rather than the end in itself, I’m glad that my results have enabled me to move forward with my goals.

I’m grateful for my friends who journeyed with me through the past two years! It was undoubtedly challenging, but the support we gave each other was what kept me grounded (even if it’s just complaining to each other about a tough paper). I’m also thankful to multiple seniors who, at different points of my academic journey, offered valuable mentorship and advice. My teachers have also played a crucial role in my journey by sharing their expertise and guidance, as well as spending countless hours at the Level 9 consultation tables.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

Unsurprisingly, juggling various commitments, inside and out of school, alongside academics led to burnout by mid-J2. Most notably, having CCA Nationals during the first week of June, followed by MYEs at the end of June was Not Fun. I’m thankful that I could lean into my support system for both academic and emotional support during this turbulent period. I’m also grateful for teachers who were understanding of my predicament and cut me some slack (In particular, I recall Mr Azhar being very understanding and willing to shift my H3 deadlines when I expressed my concerns to him!).

The unfortunate truth is that the only ‘cure’ to burnout is rest, so I made it a point to be kind to myself and try my best to rest between MYEs and Prelims! Did I feel that I had fallen behind in academics? Yes. But was it worth it in the longer run? Also yes.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Personally, the memories formed and bonds forged in my CCA, Debate, was my biggest takeaway from the past two years. EDS pushed me to challenge my boundaries as a debater and as a leader, but it also provided me with a safe space to try, fail, and grow. EDS also gave me a space to give back to the wider community through EDS VIA and organising a non-profit tournament!

Above all, the network of passionate members, who were all so willing to contribute in whatever ways they could, inspired me. From alumni who were eager to help train the up-and-coming debaters, to batchmates who gave it their all when interacting with our beneficiaries during EDS VIA, to seniors who readily offered their juniors academic and life advice – they showed me how Goodwill To All materialised in various spheres.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Two things! One, chart your own path. I believe that there is no singular route to “success” (however you define it), and what’s more important is that you truly care and are passionate about the things you do. It can be scary, but I believe that if your heart is in the right place, you’ll overcome the challenges you will inevitably face. Two, uplift those around you. I hope that, amidst the potential chaos, you remember to check in on and support those around you.

As a wise mentor once told me, “You’ll Be Fine”. Which is to say, even if you encounter obstacles, even if things don’t initially go as planned, you’ll be okay. This is not to invalidate any sadness or disappointment, but rather that there is still hope that we can solve problems and move forward.

### Low Eu Jan

On top of being Class Vice-Chairperson, **Low Eu Jan (21-U3)** participated in the college’s Global Citizenship and Advocacy Module (LATITUDE) and represented the school in various competitions as a member of Eunoia JC’s Debate Society. Eu Jan also had the opportunity to organise and adjudicate Eunoia’s Debating Championship 2022, and won several accolades in recognition of his oratorical skill.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I had a bittersweet feeling when I saw my results. Honestly, they was lower than I’d expected and I was feeling a little sad about it. Nevertheless, looking back at who I was in J1 and comparing it to the present me, I am proud of how much I have grown, learnt and achieved.

I am truly grateful for everyone who supported me through my A-Level journey; from my subject tutors who tirelessly explained concepts and suggested improvements, to my friends from CCA or from my class and beyond, with whom I shared amazing memories. Lastly, I am also grateful for my family, who ate supper with me during my A’s to destress; my parents, who ceaselessly prayed for me during my exams, as well as my brother, who helped me with GP and Economics, and shared his insights with me.

Thank you! I am so incredibly grateful for every one of you!

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

The lowest point in my JC journey was during the June holidays of my J2 year. I had to juggle studying for the MYEs while helming my CG’s Deep Dive Day project.

I relied heavily on the support systems around me to overcome my struggles. Be it studying with my friends, going out with my family, or ranting to whoever would listen, I found a lot of comfort and solace talking to those close to me. Additionally, I started to take things one at a time. Giving myself time and space to just breathe and chill brought me some relief.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

As trite as it may sound, the most meaningful part was never the destination but the journey itself. It was not the content of tutorials or lectures as much as the unique, personal insights and epiphanies that each tutor shared. It was not just the large campus and the many college events, but the many amazing people who made Eunoia home. It was not the final result, but the growth I attained as a person from trudging through to reach my final goals.

For me, the most meaningful part of my journey in EJ was the time spent meeting some of the most incredible people I have ever met. It was my privilege to learn from these “Beautiful Thinkers”. The growth that I attained by coming to Eunoia truly made my journey meaningful.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Work hard and play even harder (after your A-levels)! Don’t forget to put in your best and study (and yes, there’s a lot of studying in JC)! Please do not neglect your studies, it is not worth it in the long run. That said, don’t study 24/7 and burn out; there is so much more to life than mugging. Do the things you enjoy, and never feel guilty while doing so!

Good things take time, but don’t worry! All of you still have time! Believe in yourself and do your best - your best will always be enough!

You are definitely worth more than the sum of your grades!

### Ashley Tay

**Ashley Tay Jia En (21-U3)’s** participation in the Street Dance Student-Initiated Interest Group (SIIG) allowed her to pursue her passion for dance. Besides leading her peers in practising their choreography in Street Dance, she challenged herself by taking part in various competitions locally and overseas, developing her talent in dance and truly shining onstage as a Eunoian with the courage to pursue her passion. On top of this, Ashley was also enrolled in the Eunoia Bicultural Studies Programme, made the Dean’s List, and was awarded the MOE Pre-University Scholarship.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

I think I’m still in a state of shock right now and I haven’t fully processed my results. Prior to today, I was trying to calm myself down and set realistic expectations. So, if anything, I feel happy that I’ve surpassed my expectations and I’m relieved that my efforts have paid off!

I am grateful for my teachers, who have guided us in the past two years; with them my academic journey was in safe hands. There were countless times when I felt discouraged but I am thankful that my teachers were willing to meet me for consultations and encouraged me to keep going. I am also very grateful for my friends, who have been my pillar of support and given me motivation and lots of positive influence, even if they might not realise it! I My parents have always supported me in everything I did and they’ve never pressured me to achieve anything or be someone – I am truly grateful to them. All in all, I’m very blessed to have people who love and support me!

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

One low point I had was the period between April to September in 2022. As a J2, I definitely felt the pressure and expectations slowly build up as everyone shifted their gears and started to focus more on their studies. It was a trying time for me because I constantly felt burnt out and unmotivated academic-wise. In 2022, I took up many activities. From choreographing for Street Dance’s Humanities and Aesthetics Week performance, to pursuing my interest in dance externally and even participating in an international dance competition in May while preparing for the Mid-Year Examinations. As a result, I found myself struggling to balance my commitments and was falling behind on schoolwork. It was not easy but I had to come to terms with the fact that while my interests were what I wanted to invest time and effort in, I needed to prioritise my own mind and body too. I needed to accept that I could not over-exert myself in various aspects; I needed to give myself the time to recharge so I could go further.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Being part of the Programme Committee for Orientation 2022 allowed me to be truly immersed in EJ’s culture and leave an impact on our juniors. Everyone’s contributions, big or small, all add up to the warm welcome we gave to our juniors. I still remember coming back to school during the December holidays to choreograph the batch dance with my friends. This year, I returned for Open House 2023 and when I saw the J2s jumping, dancing and cheering at the Symposia, I felt proud to see the continuation of our legacy.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Take breaks and do not shortchange or invalidate yourself. If you're tired, you’re tired and that’s okay. Sometimes, a good night’s rest will go a long way and tomorrow's you will thank yourself for it.

Think carefully about how you would want to spend your time in JC. Five years down the road, how would you want to recall your two years here? For me, the realisation that hit me the most in J2 was that I definitely didn’t want my time here to just revolve around academics. So go for what you’re interested in and do what makes you happy!

### Liu Zonghan

**Liu Zonghan (21-U3)** was an academically outstanding Eunoian who won multiple awards in Physics Olympiads, studied Physics at H3 level, and attained the Dean’s List. He applied his academic knowledge to real-world pursuits, such as his passion for aeromodelling, leading his team to second place in the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) 2022. Zonghan added to his skillset by acquiring knowledge of coding and AI as a member of the Computing and Robotics Club.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

Throughout my JC life, I’ve always held on to the belief that one should always set realistic goals and then try one’s very best to achieve it (because if it is realistic, it should be achievable). Knowing very well where I stood, I felt calm as my results matched my expectations.

However, these results would not have been achievable if not for the guidance of so many kind and helpful teachers in our school, especially those in charge of the subjects I was weak in (such as Chemistry). Their passionate and professional teaching enabled me to reach my full potential. 

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to my tutor-referee for my UK application, Mr Koh Siong Yang from the Physics unit. He has helped me greatly in my application journey, and enabled me to achieve a successful application.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

Chemistry has always been a difficult subject for me, especially when I struggled with Organic Chemistry. To overcome such a challenge, I carved out more time for the subject. Until our graduation, I spent half my study time on Chemistry. I also sourced for online videos to complement the resources for revision we got in school!

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

The most meaningful part of my EJC journey was definitely my participation in SAFMC 2022! In this competition, our team built a radio-controlled fixed-wing aircraft to navigate a pre-designed course. As the team leader, I utilised my knowledge of aeronautics, materials and design to make our aircraft more airworthy and agile. My kind and helpful teammates also contributed great ideas for the design and aesthetics of the aircraft. I’m proud to say that our collective effort enabled us to get this far. I would like to thank the school for supporting our team, as well as our teacher-in-charge, Mr Tan Zhen Yong for overseeing the event.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

I think time management is of paramount importance in one’s JC life, and it does not necessarily mean that one must invest all time into studying. In reality, I think it means maximising the use of time by concentrating fully on the task at hand, so as to not waste any time. I believe this is the essence of ‘work hard, play hard’!

### Natalie Lim

EJC Hockey emerged as champions in the 2022 National School Games. As captain of EJC Hockey. **Lim Tze Min Natalie (21-A2)** played a key role in the victory, leading her team with empathy by force of example. Humble in victory, Natalie epitomised the attributes of character, integrity, and sportsmanship, and was awarded the Sportsmanship award in recognition of this. While she was at it, Natalie found the time to excel in her studies and attain the Dean’s List.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

Coming to school today, I felt very nervous as there was a lot of uncertainty. My results exceeded my expectations and I am very happy and thankful that my hard work has paid off.

It was definitely not an easy journey and any success I have achieved thus far is also because of the people around me. I am grateful for my parents and family who have been my strongest pillar of support throughout my JC journey, my teachers who believed in and guided me, and my friends who have encouraged me when I did not believe in myself.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

I hit my lowest point in JC1 after receiving my Mid-Year Exam results. It was then that I realised how big the jump was from secondary school to JC. I started to give myself a lot of pressure and that led to many tearful breakdowns. I am thankful for my deskmate who was there with me throughout that period of time. She gave me a safe space to express everything that I was feeling and encouraged me along the way. Having such a strong support from various people was what helped me get through the stressful times in JC.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Being able to lead my team through the National School Games as Captain of Hockey is definitely my #WhyEJ. It’s been a very fulfilling journey, and it’s not just because we emerged as champions! Seeing the team grow together, encourage one another and working hard towards our common goal was deeply heartwarming. I am thankful for the opportunity to lead and grow as a leader, and for everything that I have learn through this journey.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Enjoy the two years you have in EJ! Time will fly by very quickly, and while you focus on your studies, do enjoy the time with your CG, CCA-mates and the people you meet through various school activities. Be kind to yourself and pace yourself for the marathon ahead. It might always feel like it is the end when we don’t meet our expectations, but it’s not, and it’s okay. Despite the limited time there is, there is still time for you to improve and grow, so don’t give up at any point! It might seem hard to believe, but things will get better.
