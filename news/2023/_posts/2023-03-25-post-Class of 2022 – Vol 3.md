### Angelica Koh

A recipient of the MOE Pre-University Scholarship, **Angelica Koh Jia Qi (21-A4)** has also been involved in many college-wide programmes and activities, serving as Vice President of Symphonic Band and contributing to greater awareness of mental well-being through the GLIDE Project, Beautiful Minds.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?
I am very happy about my results because I felt that my efforts paid off! I am really grateful to my teachers because they have always been there for me, offering to consult me when I needed it, or to be a listening ear and an advisor to my daily struggles and life. Besides them, my friends are an equally great pillar of support. I am always grateful for the meals that we would have before CCA to catch up, or the early morning breakfasts we would have during late reporting days! These interactions keep me going when I have a long day in school, or when I am stressed out about meeting tight deadlines for my non-academic commitments. Last but not least, I am extremely grateful to the school for providing me with a very fulfilling 2 years of JC life that offered me many opportunities to learn beyond the classroom and from others.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

One specific challenge I faced was when I had ro represent my house in a 5km competitive run in 2022. This was a pretty uphill task as I had never taken part in a competitive run before and I only ran for leisure with my dad. I put a lot of pressure on myself as on one hand, I wanted to make my house proud and help my house win the competitive run. On the other hand, I personally also wanted to challenge myself and push my limits and make myself proud. As I also had to deal with my CCA and GLIDE commitments, as well as the intense academic workload, it was undeniably difficult to train my endurance and speed. I overcame this challenge by becoming efficient in the tasks I had to handle, so that I could free up time to train. I also tried to be consistent and diligent in keeping up with my running routine. No matter how tired I was, I ensured that I remained strong mentally and persevered through. Emerging as one of the top 5 for the female category is thus an achievement I hold dear to my heart.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Personally, the most meaningful part of my EJ journey would be being able to lead a mental health initiative alongside my peers to support the mental well-being of the student body. It was the first time that I had the opportunity, with the resources and support given, to advocate for something that I am passionate about. Being part of such an initiative meant a lot to me. It was especially meaningful as I reminisced about the late-night meetings that we had to meet the tight deadlines amidst our academic workloads and other commitments. I felt that we worked well together as a team, and I also appreciate and will really miss the sight of everyone working hard to ensure the smooth running of our initiatives. Through this initiative, I also had the chance to constantly push my boundaries and this is definitely one of my biggest #WhyEJs.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Make the most out of your JC life; 2 years will fly by before you know it! There are many opportunities provided and I hope you hop at these opportunities to develop and grow yourself outside the classroom. Always remain curious and never stop learning! Live boldly!

### Yap Jing Yee
An active Track and Field athlete since secondary school, **Yap Jing Yee (21-U3)** was passionate in pursuing sporting excellence in EJC as well, competing in several events and leading her peers as the Vice-Captain of the Track and Field team.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I am pleasantly surprised by my results as I was not expecting the grades I got. I am very grateful for the support the school has provided to help us grow in a holistic manner. In particular, my teachers offered patient guidance and supported us throughout both milestones and setbacks. I would also like to extend my gratitude to my friends, old and new, for the strong support system that I know I can rely on when the going gets tough.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

During the preparation process for the National School Games in 2022, I was physically and mentally drained from having to juggle the rigorous training and the heavy academic workload. These hectic months taught me the importance of prioritising my responsibilities and reaching out to ask for help when I need it. I am thankful for my friends who cheered me on and were a source of assurance during my competitions. Their selfless sharing of their notes also helped me to stay on track with schoolwork.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

The most meaningful part of my journey in EJ would actually be the preparation process for the A-Level Examination. It was during this process that I was able to realise for myself how important it was to establish a support system. It was also heartening to work together with my friends and see each of us overcoming each of our individual struggles. The closer bonds we forged as we studied together in between lessons, and the camaraderie amongst my classmates who were eager to help one another with schoolwork, were testament to the strong sense of community here in Eunoia – this I find meaningful.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Live in the present and cherish the moments! Apart from the rigour of JC life, there are many small yet beautiful moments that we tend to overlook but those fleeting experiences form the most precious memories that we will hold close to our hearts for a long time to come.

So enjoy the process and curate your own unique experience here in Eunoia!

### Long Wen Xi

A highly responsible Chairperson of Media Club, **Long Wen Xi (21-U1)** led with a focus on maximising the strengths of her team members. Upon graduating, she was appointed Admin Head of AEGIS, an alumni-driven academic ‘pay-it-forward’ initiative, wherein she played a critical role in selecting Subject Specialists and inspiring fellow alumni to join and help their juniors.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

More than anything, I am extremely relieved by my results and I am thankful that my efforts did not go to waste, after a lot of time spent worrying and stressing out. The A-Level period was a tough time for everyone, and I am honestly just glad that it is over.

I am grateful for my friends and family members who cheered me on and supported me throughout the two years - through all the difficult times where I felt discouraged or burnt out. A huge source of motivation for me was to make the people around me proud, and to translate the love and encouragement they constantly gave me into a sense of self-empowerment. I am truly lucky to have these people as my rocks throughout a difficult two years.

I am also very thankful for my tutors who gave up their time to meet me for weekly consultations and put in their best for me, and for their valuable life-coaching advice.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

One ‘low point’ I faced in these two years was perhaps knowing that I was honestly living an unhealthy lifestyle, yet choosing not to do anything about it. While the people around me were worried, I was stubborn and continued to sleep only a few hours every night and did not take good care of myself. With little sleep also came the emotional strain of feeling endlessly exhausted, stressed and frustrated.

I think I realised that it should not be this way, and tried to adjust my lifestyle habits slowly. By doing small things like taking breaks, going for walks, and having more regular as well as sufficient sleep.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

I had a lot of meaningful experiences in Eunoia, but one of the most significant times of my JC life was the time I spent with EJ Media. In such a dedicated and service-oriented club, I met so many people who touched my life one way or another. Serving as the Chairperson of EJ Media was a humbling, enriching and unforgettable experience. I learnt so much more about myself, and became more reflective and introspective. I believe this led me on a path of self-discovery and growth. I am also truly thankful for the many precious people I met here, who grew alongside me, and gave me space to make mistakes and learn. It was truly a wonderful part of my EJ journey and I will always look back upon it fondly.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

It may seem quite cliche, but I think I would tell them to always stay true to themselves and their values. In difficult situations, it’s more important to make decisions that resonate with what we believe in. Even if things don’t always turn out the way that we want, and we face challenges, it helps if we are our most authentic and genuine selves.

I guess another piece of advice I would give is to be more forgiving to yourself. There is always space to make mistakes and to grow from such experiences. It is these lived experiences that give us that much more depth and authenticity as humans.

### Taia Pang

For **Taia Pang (21-E3)**, her love and passion for Netball drove her to join EJC. An experienced senior to her juniors and and a key pillar of support to her peers, she guided and motivated her teammates throughout the competition season. Besides her commitment to sports, she also contributed as part of the 5th Student Council Executive Committee. Keen to take on academic challenges too, she took on H3 Chemistry to further her interest in the subject.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

I am very happy and grateful for my results because it is a good result, and the subjects that I was worried about came out well in the end. I am also very grateful for my teachers because they went out of the way to help me during my EJ journey, especially when I had to take two months of MC from the Mid-Year Exams to almost before the Preliminary Exams. Besides ensuring that I was not falling behind in my studies, my teachers also checked in to make sure that I was recovering and coping well. Another thing I am grateful for is my friends. Their various small acts of kindness, such as preparing an exam care pack or saying kind words when they notice I am feeling down, really helped me through JC.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

I think one 'low point' was definitely when I got injured one week before Netball NSG. One of the main reasons why I chose EJ was to play with the netball team here. Sustaining an injury that took me out of play after we could finally compete when the COVID restrictions were eased really made me feel very disappointed. I overcame this low point with the help of my friends. They really encouraged me during that period of intense disappointment, and I am thankful for their continued support, particularly since the recovery period for my injury took up to a year. I also came to terms with the fact that I could still contribute to my team on the sidelines by guiding them or pointing out certain mistakes so that they can improve their gameplay.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

I think that the most meaningful part of my journey would be being a part of the Student Council (SC). SC has really taught me a lot and it enabled me to work with different people that I would otherwise have never interacted with. I also think that being part of SC helped me to shape other Eunoians’ #WhyEJ, and being able to have such a positive influence has been very fulfilling. Through SC, I have made a lot of memories and friends, while also being able to leave my mark on the culture of EJ.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

For the J1s, it might be a daunting and new environment but I would encourage you to not be afraid and step out of your comfort zones. In JC, time may seem to be very short but the experiences are very intense and it is also here that the best friendships are forged, so do take a leap of faith and go forth!

For the J2s, it might seem like the A-Levels are coming very soon even though you are not ready yet, but I think that one saying that got me through J2 is 'trust the process'. Your results during the MYEs or Prelims might be shocking (in a bad way), but never lose hope and keep putting in your best effort. Ultimately, your hard work will definitely pay off!
