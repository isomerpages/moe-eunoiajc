###### What is Spartan Race about? How is it significant?

**Juliette**: The first time I heard about Spartan was through my OGLs, and from the start, my impression of Spartan was a good one!  My OGLs shared how much they genuinely enjoyed the event and I saw all the photos of J2 Eunoians huddled in their teams, cheering each other on and smiling radiantly. As I was aware that Spartan focused on challenging one’s physical capabilities, I was surprised that it was able to garner such positive responses since students are generally inclined towards feeling more hesitant when such events involve physical activities. I really appreciated the beauty of Spartan when I saw how it successfully encouraged everyone to participate enthusiastically because of the action-packed programme and opportunities to bond with their friends via mutual encouragement. At the same time, Spartan was a channel through which students were able to form core memories. With that, I can confidently say that Spartan is one of Eunoia’s most meaningful events.

###### What was your most memorable moment of Spartan Race 2023?

**Juliette**: Although I forged many memories throughout the course of planning and executing Spartan, I must say that my favourite part of Spartan Race 2023 would have to be seeing everyone have fun during the event: racing their friends during the Obstacle Race, pushing themselves to outperform the rest at various King Of the Hill stations, or even just cheering their friends from the sidelines on while taking photos to capture such moments.


###### What is your proudest moment as one of the ICs for Spartan Race 2023?

**Ernest**: My proudest moment was seeing houses, classes, and friends staying back after the event was over to take photos on the field. It showed me that Spartan was not just an event to them; it was something worth immortalising, to be captured in the moment; a memory to look back on in times to come. It validated the efforts of every single member of the team, from each ODACer, Sports rep and House rep, to the House Captains, and it made me grateful to all of them for making Spartan possible.


###### What was your #whyej moment?

**Ernest**: My biggest #whyej moment was seeing everyone come together at Spartan. Eunoia to me was never just a school; it has always been family to me, in every sense of the word. The spirit of cheering each other on and being willing to challenge oneself for a collective goal so vividly displayed at Spartan really captured what being a Eunoian was truly about. Seeing all of my fellow ODACers’ dedication and working tirelessly to make Spartan a reality, I am so proud to have been there to make this event something that gave rise to cherished memories.  Truly a #whyej moment.
