Eunoia Spartan is a core memory for our Eunoians, who participate in the physicality of the stations with grit and excited smiles. Organised by the EJC Outdoor Adventure Club, Sports Representatives and the House Committees, the annual event brings together the classes and Eunoia's five houses.

As Overall ICs of Spartan 2023, Juliette Hon (22-E6) and Ernest Foo (22-U2) reflect on their first encounter with the event and share their thoughts on planning the event and seeing the culmination of their effort.

###### **What is Spartan Race about? How is it significant?**

**Juliette**: The first time I heard about Spartan was through my OGLs, and from the start, my impression of Spartan was a good one!&nbsp; My OGLs shared how much they genuinely enjoyed the event and I saw all the photos of J2 Eunoians huddled in their teams, cheering each other on and smiling radiantly. As I was aware that Spartan focused on challenging one’s physical capabilities, I was surprised that it was able to garner such positive responses since students are generally inclined towards feeling more hesitant when such events involve physical activities. I really appreciated the beauty of Spartan when I saw how it successfully encouraged everyone to participate enthusiastically because of the action-packed programme and opportunities to bond with their friends via mutual encouragement. At the same time, Spartan was a channel through which students were able to form core memories. With that, I can confidently say that Spartan is one of Eunoia’s most meaningful events.

###### **What is  one word you would use to describe Spartan Race 2023?**

**Juliette**: Effervescent. On that day, what I saw truly displayed the vivacious nature of Eunoians as they all enthusiastically cheered for their friends who were participating in the obstacle race or King of the Hill (KOH) station.

As I walked past the various KOH stations, I saw sights of participants eagerly waiting for their turn to try the stations, participants enduring the physical fatigue as they pushed themselves to complete a few more reps and Eunoians from different houses watching tentatively while rallying them to hit new highs. 

Even after the tiring events, I saw many Eunoians who were still extremely lively and animated, running around, taking pictures with their friends and houses, to look back on and remember the Spartan Race that they took part in. As such, the atmosphere is one that encompasses both the high energies and fervent nature of all that participated.

###### **What is your proudest moment as one of the ICs for Spartan Race 2023?**

**Ernest**: My proudest moment was seeing houses, classes, and friends staying back after the event was over to take photos on the field. It showed me that Spartan was not just an event to them; it was something worth immortalising, to be captured in the moment; a memory to look back on in times to come. It validated the efforts of every single member of the team, from each ODACer, Sports rep and House rep, to the House Captains, and it made me grateful to all of them for making Spartan possible.

###### **What was your #whyej moment?**

**Ernest**: My biggest #whyej moment was seeing everyone come together at Spartan. Eunoia to me was never just a school; it has always been family to me, in every sense of the word. The spirit of cheering each other on and being willing to challenge oneself for a collective goal so vividly displayed at Spartan really captured what being a Eunoian was truly about. Seeing all of my fellow ODACers’ dedication and working tirelessly to make Spartan a reality, I am so proud to have been there to make this event something that gave rise to cherished memories.&nbsp; Truly a #whyej moment.
