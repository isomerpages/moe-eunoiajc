### Katelyn Pang

**Katelyn Pang (21-U6)** journeyed through the rigours of JC life while calmly juggling many roles and responsibilities. Besides her calm, analytical and caring personality, she is also involved in many CCAs as well, both within and outside of EJC. Outside of EJ, she is a venture scout that is on her way to winning the pinnacle award at the venture level (President's Scout Award), led and participated in various service learning opportunities with her scout troop, and her musicality also saw her being part of SIG Chamber Strings, while also being a keen participant in the Forensic Science module under Programme Altitude, and also participating in the World of Science - Electromagnetics module under the Young Defence Scientists Programme.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

One of my secondary school Chinese teachers once said, “没有期望，哪儿来的失望?” (“There can be no disappointment without expectations.”) That has been my tongue-in-cheek response whenever someone asks how I felt about my results, but today it feels especially apt.

I am eternally grateful to all who have made my time in EJ a little more exciting with banter, be it in lessons or over texts; to all who I have met along the way and shared moments with, no matter how big or small those moments were; to all who helped give me a sense of routine amidst the multiple changes to the COVID guidelines which made it challenging to settle down. Of course, I’d like to thank every single teacher whose lecture or tutorial I have sat in and the non-teaching staff for their contributions to the school community.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

One specific challenge I faced was the less-than-ideal studying environment at my house, compounded by the fact that the pandemic rendered me unable to find other places where I could study for extended periods of time. To be honest, during the Phase 2 Heightened Alert in 2021, it was a great relief when the school leaders allowed us to return to the campus for HBL if need be. In December 2021, I remembered joking about our library, saying, “All I want for Christmas… is for EJ Library to open again!”. Thankfully, more places opened subsequently. Being able to find a conducive study environment really made a difference.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

For me, it is not the ‘macro’, the events and large-scale activities, but rather the ‘micro’, the small, day-to-day interactions with people, that helped me feel what it is like to be part of the community in Eunoia. I was, and still am, not an extrovert, much less an extreme partygoer. As I like to say, “I am ‘old-people energy’”, so I really do find meaning in the little interactions with people.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

It is never too late to start (but hopefully, this is not what you’re doing for studying, J2s!). It is not too late to start breaking out of your shell! This goes out to all the ‘hermits’ in EJ. Only in JC did I step out to participate in things that I would not have tried in secondary school.

So, juniors, go all out and enjoy the JC life you have ahead!

### Tan Xing Yu

**Tan Xing Yu (21-I2)** was the Skills Head for ODAC during her time at EJC. While she had a quiet demeanour, she decided to step up and run for the executive committee because of her passion in guiding her CCA mates. She demonstrated great skills, but most importantly, the willingness to teach her peers and accommodating their requests and questions with patience. She was also dependable and a source of encouragement and support for her friends and teachers, embodying the spirit of Eunoia.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I feel really happy and a sense of relief came over me upon receiving my results, especially knowing that my hard work has paid off. I am grateful for my family, friends and teachers' support throughout this journey. It has definitely been a rather tenuous journey but I am really thankful to have people to smile and cry with.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

A low point would definitely have been the period of time before the A-Levels. It was certainly a time where many of my peers were also facing stress and pressure. I find it helpful to have frequent conversations with my friends, and confide in them my worries, as well as provide each other with the support that we need. It is really comforting to know that we are here for each other no matter what happens.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

My CCA, ODAC has definitely been part of my #WhyEJ. Being a part of ODAC, a student-led CCA, gave me the opportunity to plan various CCA sessions, and it was a really fun and fulfilling journey in ODAC. One especially memorable event would be Spartan, where our whole CCA came together to put up the event for our cohort mates, despite the various COVID-19 restrictions in place then. However, it was definitely a rewarding experience seeing the smiles on our cohort mates’ faces.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

To the JC2s: never be afraid to reach out for help as there will always be people there for you and with you! To the JC1s: never be afraid of stepping up to new experiences, as you never know what they might bring you!

### Liu Yuan

Altruistic by nature with a genuine concern for his friends, **Liu Yuan (21-I5)** initiated a peer-tutoring programme within his class, making arrangements for students who were stronger in each subject to teach certain topics to the rest. His efforts to foster a community of learners truly conveyed the spirit of Thinker with Heart.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I feel accomplished, satisfied and most importantly, grateful for the 2 years of growth in EJC. I am grateful for the people — friends, teachers and staff for transforming the school to a second home. I am grateful for the culture — a unique atmosphere of rave, dance and hype that belongs only to EJC. And I am grateful for the unwavering spirit support — be it academics or mental health. Eunoia is a JC, but also more than that. Eunoia, just like its place as a second home to me, has nurtured me in more ways than words can express. Therefore, I am grateful!

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

A difficult time in my EJ journey was during J2 March Common Tests, in which I had to balance the heavy workload and CCA thrice a week amongst the many other worries of a JC student. Understanding that my peers are in the same rocking boat with me and I was not alone, was key to helping me surmount this challenge. I found comfort, peace and strength in my friends, and this allowed me to keep trudging on.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Unsurprisingly, the most meaningful part of a quest is never the destination but the journey. My #whyEJ was found in assisting my peers academically and striving to become better together. There was simply a profound joy that grew when a few of us took the leap of faith and initiated a peer-mentoring programme. Being in EJC allows me to contribute back to a community that has nurtured me — that is my #whyEJ!

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

A quote I refer back to frequently is 'the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.' To my juniors, I say work hard and play hard. Go for the position that you were hesitating to take up — you become qualified by first being unqualified. Initiate the ideas you were unsure about — what’s there to lose? Your 2 years in EJ will pass by in an instant, there is no time to waste. Put yourselves out there and achieve your fullest potential!

### Imran Westerhout Hasan

A personable individual well-liked by his peers, **Imran Westerhout Hasan** (21-E1) also showed how he was a Leader with Courage as he took on the role of Student Council President while dealing with anxiety episodes throughout his time at EJC. Assuming the role with respect and dilligence, he shares his #whyej with us.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

My results were more than I could have ever asked for or I could have expected. Over the two years, I had been going through an unexpected period of health struggles, which completely changed the way I function. For me, even making it to and through the examinations was one of my proudest achievements at the time.

Perhaps I do not give myself enough credit, but I put in the work, and always communicated with my teachers in consultations. If I, riddled with self-doubt found success after concerted efforts were made to learn and improve, this tells me that hard work aided by confidence and belief is an unstoppable mix. Believe in yourselves and do not underestimate yourselves. At the same time, remember to help one another

Help one another. I am grateful for the teachers and friends who never said no when I asked for help. Just remember to do the same.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

No doubt my anxiety episodes that I began facing in early 2021. That stuck with me throughout my EJ years. I always end up speaking about this when people ask me about my struggles, but only because it has shaped so much of my life experience during this period.

This affected me often, in terms of my mood, my capacity for physical exertion, and my ability to comprehend information. Not being able to fully grasp knowledge certainly made it difficult to study, which was why I knew I had to change how I work.

As opposed to simply wanting to do well for exams through endless information cramming, my new goal was to enrich myself; appreciate the content from the subjects I was learning and find meaning in what I do. Speaking to teachers during consultations after self-practice also helped me hone my knowledge for an examination context.

This is how, on the academic front, I overcame my set of challenges.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Finding home and finding light after a period which dragged me down so much, and this meant finding my people and my community. Katy Perry says, 'After a hurricane comes a rainbow', but the truth is that this does not need to be linear. We all go in and out of desirable and undesirable periods and it is okay to take out time to find our light. Keep trying - despite the things that may bring us down. Finding what brings us comfort can be so worth it.

This is what made Eunoia meaningful to me.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Always always help one another, and believe in yourself. It is never ever too late to start finding your success and defining your success.

Also, do some self-practice and go for consultations. Even if there isn’t a single thing you can write down, at least read through your notes and tutorials as well as clarify the stuff you don’t understand.

I recall when my friends were far ahead of me in speed-writing for History, while I barely understood how to form an answer. I communicated this to my teacher, Mr Lee, in the consultation group, and after that learning to form an answer was the skill I focussed on developing with their help. There is no shame in taking the time to find your grounding first, before you progress and learn more!
