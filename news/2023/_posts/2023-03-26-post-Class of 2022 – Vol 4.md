### Emylia Audreyna

**Emylia Audreyna (21-O1)** was part of the MOE Humanities Scholarship Programme (HSP) and also Eunoia’s first Malay Language and Literature (MLL) student. She sought to apply the perspective taking and content she learned in a real-world setting, participating in events like the MOE Pre-University Seminar and Singapore Model United Nations. A member of the Student Council and GLIDE (Growing Leaders with Initiative, Dedication and Empathy), Emylia lived out Beautiful Thinking, Goodwill to All in the way she used her talents to help those around her.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

Results do not define us. We are more than our results. As such, while I am happy with my performance, I am still of the opinion that life is worth more than just a grade on your result slip.

I am really grateful to have gotten an A for MLL, not because it is an A but more so because of the obstacles and challenges that I had to overcome to get that grade. Thank you, Cikgu Nadira, for helping me to connect with the subject and for proving its necessity and beauty (especially in this day and age). 

I am also grateful to have SURVIVED the A-Levels. It was a tough process but I did it!

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

Truth be told, I had taken on many different commitments throughout my time in JC and having to juggle all of them alongside the rigorous A Level curriculum was without a doubt challenging. In term 2 of J2, I had taken on roles such as being the overall in charge of Council camp. Besides planning for the camp, I was also a part of the Humanities Aesthetic Week (HAW) Executive Committee. These were my 2 major commitments alongside my typical council duties as part of the Culture Committee as well as external commitments such as volunteering. 

While my days were packed to the brim, I had also learnt to rely on those around me for support. I learnt that life is not just about chasing that 90RP. Instead, I learnt to prioritise self care so as to avoid burnout.

Leaning on those around me and remembering that life is more than just grades really helped me.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Surprisingly my most meaningful part of my journey in Eunoia was also the period of time when I was at my busiest. The dinners at the playground with my fellow council camp committee made my time in JC really memorable. Our heart to heart talks after tiring council general meetings really made my week. Furthermore, watching our efforts pay off during the actual camp is also a moment which I will never forget. While handing over to the next batch of councillors felt bittersweet, it is beautiful I found something so meaningful in my short 2 years in JC, which felt hard to let go. 

I also think that the people are what made my EJ experience so meaningful. My CG mates were there for me from the very start till the end, and my council friends and I walked through hell and high waters together. They are my biggest #whyEJ

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

“It will be okay, if it is not okay then it is not the end” - I found lots of meaning in this quote and it honestly helped to tide me through the pains of JC. Life is bound to get overwhelming but at the end of it you will be okay. Grades do not define us! While the JC environment makes it feel like it does, do know that you are so so so much more than your grades. This advice can also be applied for when your commitments get tough and 24 hours does not seem like enough time. This too shall pass and you will be okay. Also, do not forget that you are loved and there are people here for you! Jiayou Juniors!

### Wang Danying

Wang Danying (21-A1) was part of the Bicultural Scholarship Programme (BSP) and offered a rare combination of Chinese Language-related H2 subjects: China Studies in Chinese, Chinese Language and Literature, and Translation (Chinese). Effectively bilingual and  deeply passionate about Chinese language and culture, she also participated in the NUS-MOE Humanities and Social Sciences Research (HSSR) programme when she took Chinese Language and Literature at the H3 level. Her talents extended to music, and Danying was a flautist in the Symphonic Band, earning a Certificate of Distinction at the SYF Arts Presentation in 2021. She was also Vice-Chairperson of the BSP Exco, and a class vice-chairperson.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I think it is within expectations. I was both shocked and surprised when I received the results. While not perfect, I am certainly grateful to my past self for having attained the best possible results and conquering the A levels to the best of my ability. I am grateful too, for all the support and encouragement I have received from my teachers who have pushed me, stretched me in many ways, be it academically, intellectually or in character. I am thankful for my peers who affirmed and supported me throughout this incredible journey of growth. Lastly, I am grateful for EJC, for providing me with ample opportunities to challenge myself and fulfil my goals.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

In semester 1 of JC2, I struggled to cope with juggling multiple commitments, as I had to devote time between Symphonic Band concerts while concurrently writing my thesis essay as part of a MOE-NUS research project I was involved in. There were times where my regular school assignments just piled up and I simply did not have enough time to catch up, which resulted in me lagging behind in certain subjects. However, I am extremely grateful to have understanding teachers who knew what I was going through and were kind enough to offer extensions that I badly needed for assignments. I pulled through by squeezing out time to socialise during regular breaks to prevent possible burnouts. After this, what was the most challenging period of my JC life became the most memorable and meaningful.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

The most meaningful part of my journey in Eunoia, was being able to fulfil the goals I set out to achieve by seizing every opportunity presented to me. For instance, being part of the BSP Exco team has been one thing I anticipated and aimed for prior to coming to EJC. Looking back, I am glad I took the opportunity to be part of the Exco team and met people who share the same interests as me. It was a memorable and fulfilling experience working with similar-minded people who put together their creativity, ingenuity and enthusiasm to organise and plan activities for BSP and our school.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Advice: I feel that there is never a “right” or “correct” version of what you want your JC life to be, and definitely no “better” ways to survive JC. Though some recommendations are sound advice, I do not think it is helpful to everyone, since all of us have our own set of beliefs and values. Some of us certainly would prioritise studies so as to prepare ourselves well for the A levels, while others would also want to focus on creating memories with their friends as time is precious here in EJC (2 years, too short!). Hence what is ultimately important is to know what you want to get out of your 2 years in EJC, what do you see as most important and proceed confidently to fulfil these goals. Perhaps, the “best” way to get through JC is one that suits you well, and leaves you with no regrets!

Encouragement: Juniors, you are all doing well in your own ways, and I am confident that all of you will be able to leave JC as better version of yourselves!

### Javier Loo

Javier Loo (21-I1) was the Valedictorian (Arts) of the Class of 2022. He was also an accomplished Taekwondo athlete, winning a bronze medal at the National School Games. As part of the organising committee of the 2022 Orientation programme, he played a key role in helping a new batch of Eunoians settle into college life.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

Extremely satisfied. I studied extremely hard the past 2 years and I tried my best to score for my classes and it mostly paid off in the form of my A-Level results. Although it is not the result that I had hoped for, it is enough for me to get into the course of my preference and I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders after this. 

I am grateful to myself for having put in the work and hours to really study consistently rather than succumbing to the temptations of slacking off under the impression that examinations are far away and that I could relax. 

But mostly, I am extremely grateful towards my teachers who believed in me and motivated me to not only improve myself, but also to improve and teach my fellow classmates. Last but not least, I am also eternally grateful to my friends and family for being my source of support during the A-Level period.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

Not getting into the Student Council was tough for me as I am a person who strives to lead others — it is something I am extremely passionate about. Although it was difficult to stomach, I learnt that certain things are just out of my control. I calmed myself down, and realised that there were other avenues for me to enact change and lead. Thus, I turned to the Orientation Exco, eventually taking on the Programmes IC position, a decision that showed me I could serve in other ways and to look for a silver lining in life.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Being able to shape Orientation ‘22 (aka Level Up ‘22) as Programmes IC helped me to bring students from both the JAE and JIP cohorts together from the very beginning of their journey. Through crafting the programmes for Level Up, my team, including Claire and Niles, decided to include more interactive events that bonded all students together, rather than just games. We came up with three that allowed the J1s to talk, discuss and exchange life experiences to connect people and make them at ease with each other. As someone who was in their shoes, I knew I wanted to minimise whatever ‘divide’ there was and made an effort to talk to as many JAE students and to give them comfort entering a new environment. Being able to do even just a little to improve the cause I wanted to serve — that was extremely meaningful to me.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

To the J2s, the reality of the A Levels may have just started to sink in. Your worries are real. Your tears, anxieties, they are all real. So, with that in mind, what are you going to do? My advice to all of you is to pace yourselves. Start early, but do not push yourselves to a point of a burnout. I have been there. Find what study methods work for you. But most importantly, figure out what helps you to destress. I cannot emphasise this enough but you should maintain your hobbies, interests. Go for a run, go to the gym, play your video games or just read a book. Doing so will not cut your effort for studying, trust me. All in all, trust the process and you will get there. Jiayou!

To the J1s, your JC life has just begun. Some of you, like I once did, may be feeling overwhelmed or intimidated. Do not be. JC is short, but it is also the most memorable, fun, exciting experience you will have in your life. While you are in JC1, remember to enjoy your JC experience. Campaign for council, join your favourite CCAs, go out and do whatever you want and do not hold back, these are all avenues for you to form lifelong bonds and friendships. Go ahead, because I assure you they will enrich both your social circle and you as an individual. Lastly, welcome to the Eunoia family! I am sure all of you, like me, will treasure and enjoy your two years here.

### Taia Pang

For **Taia Pang (21-E3)**, her love and passion for Netball drove her to join EJC. An experienced senior to her juniors and and a key pillar of support to her peers, she guided and motivated her teammates throughout the competition season. Besides her commitment to sports, she also contributed as part of the 5th Student Council Executive Committee. Keen to take on academic challenges too, she took on H3 Chemistry to further her interest in the subject.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

I am very happy and grateful for my results because it is a good result, and the subjects that I was worried about came out well in the end. I am also very grateful for my teachers because they went out of the way to help me during my EJ journey, especially when I had to take two months of MC from the Mid-Year Exams to almost before the Preliminary Exams. Besides ensuring that I was not falling behind in my studies, my teachers also checked in to make sure that I was recovering and coping well. Another thing I am grateful for is my friends. Their various small acts of kindness, such as preparing an exam care pack or saying kind words when they notice I am feeling down, really helped me through JC.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

I think one 'low point' was definitely when I got injured one week before Netball NSG. One of the main reasons why I chose EJ was to play with the netball team here. Sustaining an injury that took me out of play after we could finally compete when the COVID restrictions were eased really made me feel very disappointed. I overcame this low point with the help of my friends. They really encouraged me during that period of intense disappointment, and I am thankful for their continued support, particularly since the recovery period for my injury took up to a year. I also came to terms with the fact that I could still contribute to my team on the sidelines by guiding them or pointing out certain mistakes so that they can improve their gameplay.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

I think that the most meaningful part of my journey would be being a part of the Student Council (SC). SC has really taught me a lot and it enabled me to work with different people that I would otherwise have never interacted with. I also think that being part of SC helped me to shape other Eunoians’ #WhyEJ, and being able to have such a positive influence has been very fulfilling. Through SC, I have made a lot of memories and friends, while also being able to leave my mark on the culture of EJ.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

For the J1s, it might be a daunting and new environment but I would encourage you to not be afraid and step out of your comfort zones. In JC, time may seem to be very short but the experiences are very intense and it is also here that the best friendships are forged, so do take a leap of faith and go forth!

For the J2s, it might seem like the A-Levels are coming very soon even though you are not ready yet, but I think that one saying that got me through J2 is 'trust the process'. Your results during the MYEs or Prelims might be shocking (in a bad way), but never lose hope and keep putting in your best effort. Ultimately, your hard work will definitely pay off!
