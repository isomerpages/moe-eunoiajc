### Emylia Audreyna

**Emylia Audreyna (21-O1)** was part of the MOE Humanities Scholarship Programme (HSP) and also Eunoia’s first Malay Language and Literature (MLL) student. She sought to apply the perspective taking and content she learned in a real-world setting, participating in events like the MOE Pre-University Seminar and Singapore Model United Nations. A member of the Student Council and GLIDE (Growing Leaders with Initiative, Dedication and Empathy), Emylia lived out Beautiful Thinking, Goodwill to All in the way she used her talents to help those around her.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

Results do not define us. We are more than our results. As such, while I am happy with my performance, I am still of the opinion that life is worth more than just a grade on your result slip.

I am really grateful to have gotten an A for MLL, not because it is an A but more so because of the obstacles and challenges that I had to overcome to get that grade. Thank you, Cikgu Nadira, for helping me to connect with the subject and for proving its necessity and beauty (especially in this day and age). 

I am also grateful to have SURVIVED the A-Levels. It was a tough process but I did it!

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

Truth be told, I had taken on many different commitments throughout my time in JC and having to juggle all of them alongside the rigorous A Level curriculum was without a doubt challenging. In term 2 of J2, I had taken on roles such as being the overall in charge of Council camp. Besides planning for the camp, I was also a part of the Humanities Aesthetic Week (HAW) Executive Committee. These were my 2 major commitments alongside my typical council duties as part of the Culture Committee as well as external commitments such as volunteering. 

While my days were packed to the brim, I had also learnt to rely on those around me for support. I learnt that life is not just about chasing that 90RP. Instead, I learnt to prioritise self care so as to avoid burnout.

Leaning on those around me and remembering that life is more than just grades really helped me.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

Surprisingly my most meaningful part of my journey in Eunoia was also the period of time when I was at my busiest. The dinners at the playground with my fellow council camp committee made my time in JC really memorable. Our heart to heart talks after tiring council general meetings really made my week. Furthermore, watching our efforts pay off during the actual camp is also a moment which I will never forget. While handing over to the next batch of councillors felt bittersweet, it is beautiful I found something so meaningful in my short 2 years in JC, which felt hard to let go. 

I also think that the people are what made my EJ experience so meaningful. My CG mates were there for me from the very start till the end, and my council friends and I walked through hell and high waters together. They are my biggest #whyEJ

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

“It will be okay, if it is not okay then it is not the end” - I found lots of meaning in this quote and it honestly helped to tide me through the pains of JC. Life is bound to get overwhelming but at the end of it you will be okay. Grades do not define us! While the JC environment makes it feel like it does, do know that you are so so so much more than your grades. This advice can also be applied for when your commitments get tough and 24 hours does not seem like enough time. This too shall pass and you will be okay. Also, do not forget that you are loved and there are people here for you! Jiayou Juniors!

### Wang Danying

Wang Danying (21-A1) was part of the Bicultural Scholarship Programme (BSP) and offered a rare combination of Chinese Language-related H2 subjects: China Studies in Chinese, Chinese Language and Literature, and Translation (Chinese). Effectively bilingual and  deeply passionate about Chinese language and culture, she also participated in the NUS-MOE Humanities and Social Sciences Research (HSSR) programme when she took Chinese Language and Literature at the H3 level. Her talents extended to music, and Danying was a flautist in the Symphonic Band, earning a Certificate of Distinction at the SYF Arts Presentation in 2021. She was also Vice-Chairperson of the BSP Exco, and a class vice-chairperson.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS?

I think it is within expectations. I was both shocked and surprised when I received the results. While not perfect, I am certainly grateful to my past self for having attained the best possible results and conquering the A levels to the best of my ability. I am grateful too, for all the support and encouragement I have received from my teachers who have pushed me, stretched me in many ways, be it academically, intellectually or in character. I am thankful for my peers who affirmed and supported me throughout this incredible journey of growth. Lastly, I am grateful for EJC, for providing me with ample opportunities to challenge myself and fulfil my goals.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

In semester 1 of JC2, I struggled to cope with juggling multiple commitments, as I had to devote time between Symphonic Band concerts while concurrently writing my thesis essay as part of a MOE-NUS research project I was involved in. There were times where my regular school assignments just piled up and I simply did not have enough time to catch up, which resulted in me lagging behind in certain subjects. However, I am extremely grateful to have understanding teachers who knew what I was going through and were kind enough to offer extensions that I badly needed for assignments. I pulled through by squeezing out time to socialise during regular breaks to prevent possible burnouts. After this, what was the most challenging period of my JC life became the most memorable and meaningful.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

The most meaningful part of my journey in Eunoia, was being able to fulfil the goals I set out to achieve by seizing every opportunity presented to me. For instance, being part of the BSP Exco team has been one thing I anticipated and aimed for prior to coming to EJC. Looking back, I am glad I took the opportunity to be part of the Exco team and met people who share the same interests as me. It was a memorable and fulfilling experience working with similar-minded people who put together their creativity, ingenuity and enthusiasm to organise and plan activities for BSP and our school.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Advice: I feel that there is never a “right” or “correct” version of what you want your JC life to be, and definitely no “better” ways to survive JC. Though some recommendations are sound advice, I do not think it is helpful to everyone, since all of us have our own set of beliefs and values. Some of us certainly would prioritise studies so as to prepare ourselves well for the A levels, while others would also want to focus on creating memories with their friends as time is precious here in EJC (2 years, too short!). Hence what is ultimately important is to know what you want to get out of your 2 years in EJC, what do you see as most important and proceed confidently to fulfil these goals. Perhaps, the “best” way to get through JC is one that suits you well, and leaves you with no regrets!

Encouragement: Juniors, you are all doing well in your own ways, and I am confident that all of you will be able to leave JC as better version of yourselves!

### Long Wen Xi

A highly responsible Chairperson of Media Club, **Long Wen Xi (21-U1)** led with a focus on maximising the strengths of her team members. Upon graduating, she was appointed Admin Head of AEGIS, an alumni-driven academic ‘pay-it-forward’ initiative, wherein she played a critical role in selecting Subject Specialists and inspiring fellow alumni to join and help their juniors.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

More than anything, I am extremely relieved by my results and I am thankful that my efforts did not go to waste, after a lot of time spent worrying and stressing out. The A-Level period was a tough time for everyone, and I am honestly just glad that it is over.

I am grateful for my friends and family members who cheered me on and supported me throughout the two years - through all the difficult times where I felt discouraged or burnt out. A huge source of motivation for me was to make the people around me proud, and to translate the love and encouragement they constantly gave me into a sense of self-empowerment. I am truly lucky to have these people as my rocks throughout a difficult two years.

I am also very thankful for my tutors who gave up their time to meet me for weekly consultations and put in their best for me, and for their valuable life-coaching advice.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

One ‘low point’ I faced in these two years was perhaps knowing that I was honestly living an unhealthy lifestyle, yet choosing not to do anything about it. While the people around me were worried, I was stubborn and continued to sleep only a few hours every night and did not take good care of myself. With little sleep also came the emotional strain of feeling endlessly exhausted, stressed and frustrated.

I think I realised that it should not be this way, and tried to adjust my lifestyle habits slowly. By doing small things like taking breaks, going for walks, and having more regular as well as sufficient sleep.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

I had a lot of meaningful experiences in Eunoia, but one of the most significant times of my JC life was the time I spent with EJ Media. In such a dedicated and service-oriented club, I met so many people who touched my life one way or another. Serving as the Chairperson of EJ Media was a humbling, enriching and unforgettable experience. I learnt so much more about myself, and became more reflective and introspective. I believe this led me on a path of self-discovery and growth. I am also truly thankful for the many precious people I met here, who grew alongside me, and gave me space to make mistakes and learn. It was truly a wonderful part of my EJ journey and I will always look back upon it fondly.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

It may seem quite cliche, but I think I would tell them to always stay true to themselves and their values. In difficult situations, it’s more important to make decisions that resonate with what we believe in. Even if things don’t always turn out the way that we want, and we face challenges, it helps if we are our most authentic and genuine selves.

I guess another piece of advice I would give is to be more forgiving to yourself. There is always space to make mistakes and to grow from such experiences. It is these lived experiences that give us that much more depth and authenticity as humans.

### Taia Pang

For **Taia Pang (21-E3)**, her love and passion for Netball drove her to join EJC. An experienced senior to her juniors and and a key pillar of support to her peers, she guided and motivated her teammates throughout the competition season. Besides her commitment to sports, she also contributed as part of the 5th Student Council Executive Committee. Keen to take on academic challenges too, she took on H3 Chemistry to further her interest in the subject.

###### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

I am very happy and grateful for my results because it is a good result, and the subjects that I was worried about came out well in the end. I am also very grateful for my teachers because they went out of the way to help me during my EJ journey, especially when I had to take two months of MC from the Mid-Year Exams to almost before the Preliminary Exams. Besides ensuring that I was not falling behind in my studies, my teachers also checked in to make sure that I was recovering and coping well. Another thing I am grateful for is my friends. Their various small acts of kindness, such as preparing an exam care pack or saying kind words when they notice I am feeling down, really helped me through JC.

###### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT'? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

I think one 'low point' was definitely when I got injured one week before Netball NSG. One of the main reasons why I chose EJ was to play with the netball team here. Sustaining an injury that took me out of play after we could finally compete when the COVID restrictions were eased really made me feel very disappointed. I overcame this low point with the help of my friends. They really encouraged me during that period of intense disappointment, and I am thankful for their continued support, particularly since the recovery period for my injury took up to a year. I also came to terms with the fact that I could still contribute to my team on the sidelines by guiding them or pointing out certain mistakes so that they can improve their gameplay.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

I think that the most meaningful part of my journey would be being a part of the Student Council (SC). SC has really taught me a lot and it enabled me to work with different people that I would otherwise have never interacted with. I also think that being part of SC helped me to shape other Eunoians’ #WhyEJ, and being able to have such a positive influence has been very fulfilling. Through SC, I have made a lot of memories and friends, while also being able to leave my mark on the culture of EJ.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

For the J1s, it might be a daunting and new environment but I would encourage you to not be afraid and step out of your comfort zones. In JC, time may seem to be very short but the experiences are very intense and it is also here that the best friendships are forged, so do take a leap of faith and go forth!

For the J2s, it might seem like the A-Levels are coming very soon even though you are not ready yet, but I think that one saying that got me through J2 is 'trust the process'. Your results during the MYEs or Prelims might be shocking (in a bad way), but never lose hope and keep putting in your best effort. Ultimately, your hard work will definitely pay off!
