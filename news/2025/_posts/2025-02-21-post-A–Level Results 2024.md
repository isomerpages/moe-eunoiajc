<p></p>
<p>Congratulations on your A-level results and completing this chapter of
your life!</p>
<p>The emotions you’re feeling—euphoria, disappointment, laughter, tears—can
be overwhelming. When the dust settles, it’s helpful to remember what you
truly signed up for when you chose to come to EJC and pursue the JC and
A-levels path two years ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You didn’t sign up just to get a string of distinctions or a perfect RP
(though that would be nice). You signed up for so much more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You signed up to receive an education, to gain new and memorable experiences,
to step outside your comfort zone, to be challenged, comforted, and to
grow. You signed up to be part of a community, a family, to cultivate lifelong
friends, and through these experiences, shape your values, beliefs, character,
and identity as a Eunoian, which you will always be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You signed up to be better today than you were yesterday, to learn how
to be better tomorrow and every day after that. You signed up to take your
place in the world and make it a more beautiful and magical place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Youth with Purpose. Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage—every one
of you.</p>
<p>That’s what you signed up for, and that’s what we, your teachers, signed
up for.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You have done amazing as a cohort. Your track record over the past two
years—in sports, sciences, humanities, service to others, and more—speaks
volumes about the incredible individuals you are. The mark you’ve left
and the impact you’ve made will continue to resonate.</p>
<p>Your results, whatever they may be, are just part of your story—a story
that is already rich, compelling, and inspiring. They are a springboard
for even more to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And don’t just take it from me. Take it from cohorts of Eunoians who have
walked these same corridors, sat in the same classrooms, played on the
same fields, and eaten at the same tables—they will tell you no different.
They continue to have amazing adventures!</p>
<p></p>
<p>You’ve done it. Regardless of your results, you will keep doing it. Nothing
is going to stop you. Beautiful Thinking, Goodwill to all around you!</p>
