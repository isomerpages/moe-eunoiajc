<p>The Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) Appeal Exercise is for students who
have not been posted to Eunoia Junior College (EJC) under the JAE Posting
Exercise. Students admitted to other institutions via Direct School Admission
(DSA-JC) are not eligible for this exercise.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;official appeal period for JAE is from&nbsp;<strong>4 Feb 2025</strong> to <strong>10 Feb 2025</strong> (1700
hours). Appeals for transfer to Eunoia Junior College will be based on
merit. Students who wish to appeal on other grounds are unlikely to be
successful if they have not met the course Cut-Off Point for the year and
do not present extenuating circumstances to merit a transfer.</p>
<p>The 2025 Cut-Off Point for the Science course is <strong>5</strong> and
the Arts course is <strong>6</strong>.</p>
