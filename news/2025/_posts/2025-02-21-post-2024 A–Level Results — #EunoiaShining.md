<p>Eunoia Junior College congratulates our Class of 2024 for their holistic
achievements at the 2024 Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Examination. The
college is proud of all 715 Eunoians, having done themselves proud at the
National School Games and the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
in 2023 and 2024, making a positive impact on the community and the environment
with school-based and self-initiated projects, and making the college one
of beautiful thinking.</p>

<p>Mr Andrew Tan, our Principal, shared his message to the Class of 2024:
"Congratulations on your A-level results and completing this chapter of
your life! The emotions you’re feeling—euphoria, disappointment, laughter,
tears—can be overwhelming. When the dust settles, it’s helpful to remember
what you truly signed up for when you chose to come to EJC and pursue the
JC and A-levels path two years ago. You didn’t sign up just to get a string
of distinctions or a perfect RP (though that would be nice). You signed
up for so much more.</p>
<p>You signed up to receive an education, to gain new and memorable experiences,
to step outside your comfort zone, to be challenged, comforted, and to
grow. You signed up to be part of a community, a family, to cultivate lifelong
friends, and through these experiences, shape your values, beliefs, character,
and identity as a Eunoian, which you will always be.</p>
<p>You signed up to be better today than you were yesterday, to learn how
to be better tomorrow and every day after that. You signed up to take your
place in the world and make it a more beautiful and magical place. Youth
with Purpose. Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage—every one of you.
That’s what you signed up for, and that’s what we, your teachers, signed
up for.</p>
<p>You have done amazing as a cohort. Your track record over the past two
years—in sports, sciences, humanities, service to others, and more—speaks
volumes about the incredible individuals you are. The mark you’ve left
and the impact you’ve made will continue to resonate. Your results, whatever
they may be, are just part of your story—a story that is already rich,
compelling, and inspiring. They are a springboard for even more to come.</p>
<p>And don’t just take it from me. Take it from cohorts of Eunoians who have
walked these same corridors, sat in the same classrooms, played on the
same fields, and eaten at the same tables—they will tell you no different.
They continue to have amazing adventures! You’ve done it. Regardless of
your results, you will keep doing it. Nothing is going to stop you. Beautiful
Thinking, Goodwill to all around you!"</p>
<p>Ms Yang Shu Hung, Dean for the Class of 2024, added, "</p>

<p>The growth and achievements of our Eunoians would not be possible without
the dedication and support of teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, alumni,
College Advisory Committee, our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools
and our many industry and community partners. To the Class of 2024, may
your dreams take flight and may you continue to shine in years and decades
to come.</p>
