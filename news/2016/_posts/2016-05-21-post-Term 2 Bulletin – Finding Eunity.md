**Dear Parents and Alumni Members,**

All journeys have a beginning, a middle and an end. Midpoints are a good time to take stock and review what we have accomplished thus far. In a few more months, we will see the final uniform design chosen by our students, move to the Mount Sinai campus, share with our pioneer cohort what they can expect in JC1 and welcome a group of Year 4 Eunoians for a tour of their future school grounds.

What began as a vision six years ago is fast becoming a reality. It was heartening to flip the pages of our inaugural prospectus and read about the rigorous, exciting programmes planned by our Heads of Department. Parents, students and fellow educators have responded positively to our prospectus and website, commending the spread of our programmes and the beautiful thinking that extends from our education philosophy to our curriculum design. It was encouraging to hear these positive words and be reminded of how far we have come.


In the month of May, we had the privilege to share the Eunoia ethos with even more students and parents from other secondary schools. At the University Cultural Centre, we called for prospective Eunoians to Be The First and spoke to enthusiastic parents and students over morning tea. Our Heads of Department shared with our audience their commitment to student voice and empowering students to be the best they can be, and to co-create the Eunoia identity with us. We were also delighted to receive a warm welcome by students at CHIJ St Theresa’s Convent and the School of Science and Technology (SST), and engaged their passionate questions on JC life and the Eunoia identity. This rapport with prospective students and parents is something we will keep close to our hearts, as we foster new relationships with schools, students, parents and the wider community.

### Mount Sinai Campus Rejuvenation Works

With people at its centre, a house becomes a home. Renovations at our Mount Sinai campus are progressing smoothly and will be completed by end-September. The field has been re-turfed, the new classroom block is taking shape and our plans to furnish the Media Resource Library, CCA rooms, music practice rooms, Bicultural Studies Programme and Humanities Scholarship Programme resource rooms will soon be realised. We are proud to share that several spaces such as the student lounge, sky garden and the staff room are in the process of being designed by groups of students from the three schools and teachers who have just joined us. Trust and ownership are part of the narrative. Just as importantly, we believe that a school campus comes together only when Eunoians and their teachers build it together. While others might see bricks and walls, we see ourselves building a school, and a culture that will follow us to the distant future.

### The Eunoia Uniform Designed with Style

Our students and teachers have been working hard in the past few months to create a Eunoia identity we will be proud of. Behind the scenes, the college staff have been liaising with styleXstyle to refine our uniform design options, with the support of CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School alumnae Ms Sharon Au and Ms Tan Mae Shen. Two of our budding student-designers, whose concepts were selected from over 70 student entries, were then invited to come on board. Over the June holidays, they underwent a mentorship session with Reckless Ericka designer Ms Afton Chen, weaving both her advice and feedback from their peers into their final designs. Reckless Ericka was also commissioned to draft a third uniform option for the college. Samples of all three design options will be unveiled to our students in the Joint Integrated Programme in the middle of July. As educators first and foremost, it was rewarding to allow our future Eunoians to gain new skills and knowledge outside the classroom. The college’s partnership with styleXstyle provides a glimpse of the endless learning opportunities we want our students to enjoy, and opportunities that they too will seek by themselves.

> The starting point of the Eunoia legacy stands just ahead of us, and we will continue to make history far beyond the horizon.

Great teachers design out-of-the-ordinary learning experiences for our students. This week, we have had the pleasure of welcoming fourteen new teachers from a diverse range of teaching backgrounds. If you were with us, you would have seen and heard their collective desire to create curricula that will educate the heart, mind and spirit of every Eunoian. As pioneering staff, they have committed themselves to be united in overcoming challenges and flying closer towards our vision — for each Eunoian to be a Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage. The starting point of the Eunoia legacy stands just ahead of us, and we will continue to make history far beyond the horizon.


### Coming Together, Finding Eunity

In the weeks to come, we will be visiting our partner schools to share exciting news on our special programmes, the college crest and the Mount Sinai campus, as well as unveil the final three uniform designs that students will vote for. In addition, we will be meeting parents and members of alumni to hear their thoughts on these key developments, and gather suggestions on the unique learning experiences we can give to our Eunoians. We would like to take this opportunity to invite you to provide us your suggestions and contributions to the Eunoia journey. You are welcome to write to us at eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg, or give us a call at 6351 8388. Even as our family of students, parents and staff continues to grow, we recognise that we are stronger together; together we will make Eunoia Junior College stronger.
