**Dear Parents and Alumni Members,**

Lessons are now in full swing and our Eunoians are getting settled into the daily rhythm of college life. The movement from lecture theatre to lecture theatre, the precious minutes to complete tutorials, and the late, enjoyable evenings spent with CCA mates are some of the lasting memories you might have had of JC life which our students have experienced for only a few weeks.

It was not long ago that our first class of students, from our three partner schools and 41 more secondary schools, came together as one. The sight of them pinning their badges on each other was a heartening reminder that they are the first to carry our legacy, and also the makers of Eunoia's history.

## A Legacy is Born

The pages of our history are being filled with many landmarks and great stories. With our uniform and collar pin, we have had the privilege of launching the college anthem, winning our first medals, seeing ourselves in the news, and making it into the Singapore Book of Records. None of this would have been realised without the stellar effort of our Eunoians, who have stepped up and led the way in every instance. The inaugural EJC Orientation, planned and brought to life by almost two hundred students, gave us a week of dancing, cheering, games, and memories that would last many years down the road. Within the passion and zeal, the spirit in which they welcomed JAE students as friends from the first day stands out, and we are confident that the Eunoia family will grow stronger as we spend many more precious moments together.

## Stellar Progress

The campus has certainly grown more vibrant by the day. We have seen early-morning flash mobs, a jamming studio packed with aspiring bands, guest speakers from diverse industries and practices, as well as new artwork decorating our walls. Add to this a buzzing student lounge and colourful birthday celebrations and we have seen signs of a fuller college life that will grow into a student culture that is uniquely ours. Eunoia unites, Eunoians shine.

In the four weeks of school we have witnessed so far, our students have also shone on the national stage. Our Biology and Physics students have done us proud at academic competitions against JC2 competitors. Two teams from ODAC performed very commendably at the EW Barker Challenge and also emerged with silverware to show for their efforts.

In the weeks to come, even more of our athletes, performers and scholars will compete rigorously with their peers at the National School Games, Singapore Youth Festival presentations and other competitions. We hope that they value the experience, the chance to test themselves and the stronger friendships they will forge along the way. Go out there to win with grace and lose with glory, because competition is about showing and gaining strength. Eunoians do, Eunoia shines.

## Seek and Find

The start of our flagship programmes promises to help them accomplish just that. Our students have been assigned a Life Coach — their Civics Tutor, a school leader or middle manager of their choice — who will journey with them to uncover their strengths, passions and priorities in life. We have also completed two Deep Dive Days that took our Eunoians deeper into who they are, and the values they represent. Across the two full days, our students reflected on the meaning of home, love and sexuality, asking difficult questions while also uncovering personal answers. These learning experiences beyond the academic domains are core to the Eunoia DNA, and our commitment to develop every Eunoian’s purpose, heart and courage.

## Steady Support

Parents are a vital part of this passage. We were enthused to see so many parents at our first Parent-Teacher Meet in Term One, and also encouraged by the questions and feedback given by each parent during the breakout sessions. Sowing these seeds of understanding with our parents and our parent partnership group Parents@Eunoia, we hope that our Eunoians will reap a rewarding experience here at Eunoia in the next two years.

We believe that the possibilities for Eunoians will grow exponentially with the support of parents and alumni of our JIP partner schools. In the June (29 May - 7 Jun 2017) and December (27 Nov - 8 Dec 2017) vacation periods, our Eunoians will be venturing to experience working life in both private and public sectors, and begin to shape their own professional journey. Some will also be embarking on short externships during the school term, where they will shadow professionals and understand the day-to-day trials in an industry or area they are passionate about.

We are glad to have received the emphatic support of our stakeholders in providing these internship and externship opportunities, and hope that you too can help us broaden our Eunoians’ perspectives of the world. We welcome you to write to us at [eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg](mailto:eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg) or call us at 6351 8388 if you would like to partner us in creating an authentic educational experience.

## And Shine We Will

Our students have the calibre to contribute and create value in all that they commit themselves to. They reflect upon their experience at each stage, and unwaveringly ask how they can bring out the best in others. They are not the tourists of their youth. Rather, they are always conscious of the people around them, and always ready to appreciate the experiences that await them. As challenges and competitions crowd around, may our Eunoians remember to shine, always.
