Eunoia Junior College commemorated the move from its interim Mount Sinai campus to its new home in Bishan on 6 Jan 2020. The Big Move began with a symbolic relay at Mount Sinai, with alumni from the first class of Eunoians bearing flags and making their way to Rifle Range Road via the Green Corridor. Led by Mr Chuah Jun Jie and Mr Justin Lee, they would hand over the flags to the Class of 2019 for the next leg. Receiving them at the Central Catchment Nature Reserve was a large contingent of JC2 Eunoians together with Ms Loo Jia Ning and Mr Omar Basri Sulaimir who navigated challenging terrain to arrive at Windsor Nature Park. Parent representatives and our incoming JC1 Eunoians from the Joint Integrated Programme partner schools would take the flags to Bishan Active Park.

The festivities at Bishan Active Park began as early as 8am, and the cheers grew upon the arrival of the new Eunoians at 9am and the relay participants around 10am. The college population then began a mass walk to the Bishan campus via Bishan - Ang Mo Kio Park.

The five houses, Akila, Eder, Isami, Ora and Uzuri, entered the college via different gates and converged at the elevated stadium. With equal style, Student Council President Lum Wan Tong (19-U1) arrived with the college flag on the electric vehicle developed by the Makerspace interest group, and handed it to EJC principal Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng. Singing the college anthem for the first time at the Bishan campus, the Class of 2020 and 2021 truly made #EunoiaHome.
