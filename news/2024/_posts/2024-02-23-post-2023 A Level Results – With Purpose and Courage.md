<p>Mr Jared Goh, Dean for the Class of 2023, shares his message to the cohort,
‘Congratulations Class of 2023! As you graduate from Eunoia, remember that
the world is your oyster and the pearls within are yours to discover. Stay
rooted in the values that have shaped you as you navigate the exciting
opportunities that lie ahead. The knowledge you've gained, the friendships
you've nurtured, and the challenges you've overcome in EJ have moulded
you to become the person that you are today. I genuinely hope that you
stay humble, embrace who you are as a unique individual and harness your
strengths to make a positive difference to the larger community.’</p>
<p>Our Principal Mr Andrew Tan added, 'Congratulations to the Class of 2023!
You have been a spirited, talented and lovely batch. My colleagues and
I feel so blessed to have been a part of your journey. You had an amazing
two years and your A-Level results are part of the journey. Many of you
were elated. It was wonderful to hear the many shouts of euphoria and the
tears of joy – I couldn’t help but feel how much this moment must mean
to you!</p>
<p>My heart goes out to those who were disappointed today if your results
were not quite what you were expecting. Be in this moment, experience the
emotions and seek comfort in those around you who care for you. And once
that is dusted, know that your world and your path ahead is brighter than
you can ever imagine – this too will soon and one day become part of your
Hero’s journey.</p>
<p>Once again, it has been such a privilege to have been in your midst and
journeyed with you! You will prevail. Even if the road takes a little longer,
enjoy the scenery because you will prevail. Continue to bring Eunoia –
the spirit of Beautiful Thinking, Goodwill to All – to everyone around
you. All the very best and hope to catch you back in college some time!'</p>

<p>The growth and achievements of our Eunoians would not be possible without
the dedication and support of teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, alumni,
College Advisory Committee, our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools
and our other partners. To the Class of 2023, we wish you Eunoia. As your
dreams take flight, may you continue to shine your goodwill and beautiful
thinking on all around you.</p>
