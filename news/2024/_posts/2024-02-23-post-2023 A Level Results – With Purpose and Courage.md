<p>Mr Jared Goh, Dean for the Class of 2023, shares his message to the cohort,
‘Congratulations Class of 2023! As you graduate from Eunoia, remember that
the world is your oyster and the pearls within are yours to discover. Stay
rooted in the values that have shaped you as you navigate the exciting
opportunities that lie ahead. The knowledge you've gained, the friendships
you've nurtured, and the challenges you've overcome in EJ have moulded
you to become the person that you are today. I genuinely hope that you
stay humble, embrace who you are as a unique individual and harness your
strengths to make a positive difference to the larger community.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>The growth and achievements of our Eunoians would not be possible without
the dedication and support of teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, alumni,
College Advisory Committee, our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools
and other partners. To the Class of 2023, we wish you Eunoia. As your dreams
take flight, may you continue to shine your goodwill and beautiful thinking
on all around you.</p>
