<h3><strong>Charlotte Lee </strong>(22-I2)</h3>
<p>An outstanding Netball captain who continually strove for improvement,
Charlotte Lee led by example both within and outside the classroom.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Who or what were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong>
</p>
<p>“Home is where the people are.” I guess coming into EJ, I could finally
understand this quote and truly relate to it. Eunoia is my second home.
Through EJ, I have gotten the chance to cross paths with some of the most
amazing people, be it my peers or my tutors. These people have been my
pillars of support throughout these two years, being the reason I could
stay motivated and keep going. It was not simply the “Jiayou(s)” and small
encouragement snacks that gave me a boost; it was the feeling of camaraderie
and trust with them that allowed me to know I was not alone. At the hardest
times when I felt defeated or when I almost wanted to give up, the faith
that my tutors and peers had in me gave me strength to persevere. They
gave me a reason to smile and tell myself that it was not the end!</p>
<p>Taking up multiple commitments in EJ, I had a busy time, but it was truly
exhilarating. Looking back, I have no regrets and, certainly, enjoying
what I was doing really helped give me motivation to carry on! I found
reasons to love and appreciate, like the strength of journeying together
as a team, or bonding with a community of incredible individuals in my
house (Isami!). Hence, alongside practising time management and maintaining
consistency in order to juggle my responsibilities, I think viewing these
responsibilities as wonderful memorable experiences I had the opportunity
to journey through made them a source of joy instead of a burden.</p>
<h6><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia you are grateful for?</strong></h6>
<p>I am wholeheartedly grateful to Eunoia, for allowing me to experience
the true beauty of “work hard, play hard”. This idea is not one that was
new or foreign to me before, but I never really got to experience it at
such a deep level until I came to EJ.</p>
<p>Through Eunoia, I was given the chance to feel the highest ‘highs’ despite
the stressful journey. Each school event brought me euphoria and I was
enjoying each moment to the fullest, with my heart feeling warm and full
after! Being gifted with such times of relief made it much easier to spend
time with our heads in the books. It helped me manage stress much more
easily while coping with my commitments and academics. Stepping out of
EJ, this feeling of fulfilment and achievement is one that grants me the
ability to say that I have no regrets. I am grateful for each and every
individual I have met here, and every opportunity I was given to live my
Eunoian life to the fullest. Thank you EJ, for letting my dreams take flight!</p>
<h6><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong></h6>
<p>To my batchmates, I want to say Congratulations! We made it! Two years
ago, when we first entered Eunoia, some of us could never have pictured
how the next two years of our lives would play out. Now that it’s over,
we can look back on the memories we have made, friendships forged, and
challenges we’ve overcome, using them as our sources of motivation for
the journey ahead of us.</p>
<p>To the new J1s, I hope you will make this EJ experience uniquely yours!
Take risks and try new things, meet new people and form networks, and make
every moment count.</p>
<p>Lastly to the current J2s, do not forget to let yourself breathe every
once in a while, and enjoy this final year in Eunoia. Even though A levels
may seem daunting and scary, be brave, stay consistent and remember to
rest! To quote EJ Netball’s team motto, keep striving and giving it your
all “to the end”. EU-GOT THIS!</p>

<h3><strong>Gisele Lee</strong> (22-I1)</h3>
<p>Gisele marvelously juggled leading the Hockey team into the National School
Games as Vice-Captain with taking on a leading role at the much anticipated
annual Literature Festival that brings texts to life. In doing so, she
leaves Eunoia with a rich, fulfilling experience, and she shares some tips
for how other Eunoians could do the same.</p>
<h6><strong>Who or what were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong></h6>
<p>If you were to ask me how I managed to balance all my commitments, the
short answer is that it's a matter of sacrifice. I’m not a perfect person
and I definitely had a hard time balancing my time between Hockey training
sessions, keeping up with schoolwork, and participating in all the various
school events and activities. There were times when I was frustrated with
myself for being unable to handle everything that was on my plate, and
fell behind in my studies. However, I’m incredibly lucky and privileged
to be studying subjects that I’m interested in and passionate about, and
this motivated me to stay engaged in class and catch up with my lectures.</p>
<p>Additionally, balancing being in a leadership role as Vice-captain of
Hockey was definitely one of the toughest and most challenging experiences
of my time here in EJ. But seeing my teammates improve rapidly over the
short year and watching how much each of them had grown has made me want
to give my all to my CCA, no matter the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Having the support of my friends and family also definitely helped in
managing my commitments, whether they lent a listening ear, or invited
me to study together, their support and guidance played a key role in helping
me balance everything. Lastly, I am forever grateful for my Captain, Anya,
for being one of the biggest pillars of support. She journeyed with me,
watching me grow both as a person and as a leader. Thank you for pushing
me to be my best, and to never be afraid to call out my areas of weaknesses
to help better myself, I don’t know how I could have done it without you.</p>
<h6><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia you would like to keep with you?</strong></h6>
<p>One thing that really stands out about EJ for me is the opportunities
and avenues that the school has that allows students to express themselves
and to just have fun. One memorable experience was when I impulsively signed
up to perform at the Valentines’ Day busking session. Although the event
may seem inconsequential, that experience is a core memory for me.</p>
<p>Performing with the aim to make my friends and other college mates laugh,
I could really feel the love (get it?) that Eunoians have for one another,
teaching me not to take JC life too seriously and spurred me to sign up
for more school activities despite any second thoughts. This experience
certainly shaped me into becoming a more daring person who is not afraid
of trying new things, and expressing myself in new and creative ways.</p>
<h6><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong></h6>
<p>Looking back on my time in EJ, I’m surprised that the things I miss most
are the little, everyday things. Simple things like squishing into the
lift in the morning to avoid being late, setting up the metal boards around
the pitch during CCA, struggling to understand theories in econs lessons,
or looking forward to literature lectures just to marvel at Mr Lim’s slides.
Back then, I remember wanting time to pass by as fast as possible, to move
on with the next topic, to the next assignment, to get to the part where
A-levels were over so that I no longer needed to feel stressed or study
anymore. However, now whenever I take a sip of teh ping, or eat duck noodles,
I would be reminded of just how short, yet impactful my time here in EJ
was.</p>
<p>So to my juniors, I urge you to take things slow, enjoy the process of
learning, and to find the joy in the little things! I want to assure you
that when you graduate, you will remember not your grades, but the activities
that you participated in and the friendships you have forged along the
way. The time you have in EJ may be short, but the memories you make here
will definitely last forever.</p>
<p>To my batchmates: We did it! I cannot believe how far we have all come
since the start of orientation to graduation and how all of us have grown
and changed. These past 2 years were filled with both ups and downs, but
I hope all of you had a good rest after A-levels. I wish all of you the
best in your future endeavours!</p>

<h3><strong>Valerie Ang </strong>(22-I6)</h3>
<p>A national figure-skater, Valerie spent hours making her incredible routines
in the rink look effortless, and channeled this same determination, purpose,
and passion into her academic and leadership endeavours in EJC. Here, she
shares what kept her going and some words of encouragement.</p>
<h6><strong>Who or what were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong></h6>
<p>Eunoia has been an unforgettable journey but it definitely hasn’t been
easy. My greatest source of motivation in my time in Eunoia was my very
supportive friends and teachers who were always there to guide and encourage
me, both during exam and competition seasons. It's the little things like
asking how my training went, or asking if I needed help with assignments
that made my days a little more memorable. Ice skating training was always
an outlet for me to destress and take a break from the academic aspects
of school, so it never felt like just another task or chore to be done.
Instead I looked forward to and was excited for training daily, and it
has honestly been the biggest motivation of it all for me to work harder
in school, or finish my assignments before I leave school so that I have
a clear mind going into training!</p>
<h6><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia you would like to keep with you?</strong></h6>
<p>Cosmos 2023 has got to be my greatest #whyej for sure and i am so very
grateful for having the opportunity to be a part of such an amazing orientation
exco, and also our amazing orientation team as a whole. Being able to work
behind the scenes of Cosmos from 4 months before ori, up til the finale
of Cosmos, was nothing I could have anticipated. During touchdown on the
finale night, the echoing of joyous symphony of singing, cheering for their
respective houses and dancing the night away, while witnessing my fellow
eunoians’ faces illuminated by genuine smiles and infectious happiness
is truly a moment I'll never forget. It was in that moment that I thought
to myself: this exact moment is what made the past four months of hard
work all worth it.</p>
<h6><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong></h6>
<p>These two years are short, slow down and enjoy life a little before it
all passes by in a flash. Create memories, unforgettable friendships, and
be in the present!</p>
