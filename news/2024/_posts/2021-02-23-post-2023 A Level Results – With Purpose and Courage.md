<p>Mr Jared Goh, Dean (JC2) for the Class of 2023, shared his message to
the cohort, ‘Congratulations Class of 2023! As you graduate from Eunoia,
remember that the world is your oyster and the pearls within are yours
to discover. Stay rooted in the values that have shaped you as you navigate
the exciting opportunities that lie ahead. The knowledge you've gained,
the friendships you've nurtured, and the challenges you've overcome in
EJ have moulded you to become the person that you are today. I genuinely
hope that you stay humble, embrace who you are as a unique individual and
harness your strengths to make a positive difference to the larger community.’</p>
