### Christie Callia Sardjono

Student Council President, Humanities Scholar, H3 Literature student, leader, organiser, ardent dancer, emcee and friend — **Christie Callia Sardjono (22-U1)** from the Class of 2023 can shine in any role but her kindness, passion and dedication are what all of us in Eunoia know her for. She shares with us some of her precious memories and words of wisdom.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EJC?

The people I met in EJC are the reasons why my time here has been so special. Over the past two years, I’ve been blessed to cross paths with the most passionate, kind and selfless people I’ve ever met. From the breaks I’ve spent with my class in the canteen, the tireless nights with the 6th Student Council preparing for our events, the consultations my teachers have given me (on both academics and life) to the passing conversations along the corridors, Eunoia’s community is what has made this place my second home, and gifted me with friendships which I believe can last a lifetime.

###### WHAT IS ONE EXPERIENCE, FEELING OR IDEA FROM YOUR TIME IN EJ YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WITH YOU, OR ARE GRATEFUL FOR?

The feeling of adrenaline that comes the moment a college dance song plays never gets old. I will always treasure the camaraderie and energy coursing through the Eunoia community whenever we come together, no matter where we are or who we are standing next to.

###### WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THE CLASS OF 2023 AND YOUR JUNIORS?

I hope we can bring the spirit of Eunoia with us wherever we go, daring to dream big, and always taking the courage to turn those dreams into reality. I believe that the past two years have brought us through the most exhilarating and fulfilling journey of self-discovery, and no matter where life takes us, Eunoia will always be there as a space and community for us to look towards. <br> 
To the Class of 2024 and beyond, keep the spirit of Eunoia alive and embrace every chance you get to discover something new. The Eunoia community is incredibly special, so treasure each moment you have with your friends and teachers, and always remember to be there for one another!

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EJC?

One struggle that ended up heavily impacting my JC life is my ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD at the end of my first year of JC in 2021. It came as a surprise to a lot of people as I have always done quite well in school, coming from the Gifted Education Program and doing decently well academically in both primary and secondary school, but I had been feeling the effects of my condition for a good part of the year, and it was the cause of my eventual retaining. <br> 
I maintained a positive attitude about my newly diagnosed neurodivergence, having already suspected the condition and researched it myself beforehand. It was not the end of the world and I was not lesser for it, I simply needed to figure out how to work with it. I spent a long time learning more about the condition and looking for ways that would help me and work with my brain rather than against it, as typical methods for studying and keeping on top of things simply did not work for me no matter how hard I tried. Over the course of the next two years at EJC, I picked up coping mechanisms for myself as well as got support from my friends, family and teachers. I also learnt from my mistakes in my first year, paced myself better and prioritised my mental health more. <br> 
In the end, things did not magically become perfect. But I did see noticeable personal growth on my end, as well as a greater understanding and acceptance of myself. I even made it the focus of my A level final project for Art, in the hopes of sharing my experience with others.

###### WHAT IS ONE EXPERIENCE, FEELING OR IDEA FROM YOUR TIME IN EJ YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WITH YOU, OR ARE GRATEFUL FOR?

I think one thing I would like to keep from my time in EJ are the relationships I made with my peers from both my first and second cohort, my juniors and my teachers. <br> 
When I first retained one thing I was worried about was losing my friends who were now going to graduate earlier than me, and being able to make new ones because of my situation. But in the end that wasn’t a problem at all. People are kinder than you think and I am so grateful to the people that have supported me and took time to understand me, and that I was not treated differently. I’m thankful for the friendships and memories I’ve made at EJ. <br> 
I am also grateful for the support and encouragement of my teachers. Thank you for keeping an open mind and accommodating me, while still encouraging me to do well and improve. I would especially like to thank my art teachers, who encouraged me to put my experiences into my art coursework and share it as a part of me to be proud of and accept. I would also like to thank my co-form teacher for checking up on me to see how I was doing and offering help when I needed it.

###### WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THE CLASS OF 2023 AND YOUR JUNIORS?

To the Class of 2023: We made it! I’m so proud of us for pushing through these last few years and I wish us all the best for the future. <br>
To my juniors: JC life will be stressful, and the jump from secondary school to junior college can be tough to navigate. It is hard to keep up, especially because JC is a lot more self directed than secondary school. But I promise that it is not the end of the world if you fail a test. Academics is important, but it isn’t everything. Please take care of your mental and physical health. I know it sounds cheesy but as someone who spent way too many late nights desperately trying and failing to keep up with my work in the first year, I found that prioritising my sleep more in my second year helped a lot, both with managing my ADHD symptoms and just my quality of school life.<br>
You also should reach out for help if you need it. I struggled to ask for help because I felt like I could tough it out, and before getting my diagnosis and understanding why exactly I was struggling so much I was perhaps a little embarrassed too. But my teachers have been incredibly understanding and supportive of me. They want their students to pass as much as you do, and they’re willing to help or give you a bit more time if you just ask. If consulting a teacher alone is too scary, arrange a group consult with your friends. As my teacher once told me: “Don’t suffer in silence.”<br>
Lastly, remember to have fun! Yes JC is stressful, but that isn’t all there is to it. There are so many fun events to look forward to at EJC and you should enjoy them! And I mean really enjoy them. I know it’s easy to continue stressing about school even as you take time off, lamenting all the work you still have to do once this is over. But you’re still using energy to worry about all that while to take your supposed “break”. That’s not really resting now is it? Work hard, play hard. Your studies are important but make sure to take time to enjoy these two (or more!) years at EJ.
