### Christie Callia Sardjono

Student Council President, Humanities Scholar, H3 Literature student, leader, organiser, ardent dancer, emcee and friend — **Christie Callia Sardjono (22-U1)** from the Class of 2023 can shine in any role but her kindness, passion and dedication are what all of us in Eunoia know her for. She shares with us some of her precious memories and words of wisdom.

###### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EJC?

The people I met in EJC are the reasons why my time here has been so special. Over the past two years, I’ve been blessed to cross paths with the most passionate, kind and selfless people I’ve ever met. From the breaks I’ve spent with my class in the canteen, the tireless nights with the 6th Student Council preparing for our events, the consultations my teachers have given me (on both academics and life) to the passing conversations along the corridors, Eunoia’s community is what has made this place my second home, and gifted me with friendships which I believe can last a lifetime.

###### WHAT IS ONE EXPERIENCE, FEELING OR IDEA FROM YOUR TIME IN EJ YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WITH YOU, OR ARE GRATEFUL FOR?

The feeling of adrenaline that comes the moment a college dance song plays never gets old. I will always treasure the camaraderie and energy coursing through the Eunoia community whenever we come together, no matter where we are or who we are standing next to.

###### WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THE CLASS OF 2023 AND YOUR JUNIORS?

I hope we can bring the spirit of Eunoia with us wherever we go, daring to dream big, and always taking the courage to turn those dreams into reality. I believe that the past two years have brought us through the most exhilarating and fulfilling journey of self-discovery, and no matter where life takes us, Eunoia will always be there as a space and community for us to look towards. <br> To the Class of 2024 and beyond, keep the spirit of Eunoia alive and embrace every chance you get to discover something new. The Eunoia community is incredibly special, so treasure each moment you have with your friends and teachers, and always remember to be there for one another!
