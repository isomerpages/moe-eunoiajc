<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p><strong>Internship &amp; Externship Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>To help Eunoians gain exposure and insight into industries of their interest,
the Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education (CSH) Committee is working
to provide them with internship and externship opportunities. We hope that
such experiences will allow our students in JC1 and our incoming students
from our Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) schools to gain a better understanding
of themselves and&nbsp;make informed choices for their future courses of
study and careers.</p>
<p>We hope to provide the following internship and externship opportunities
to our students:</p>
