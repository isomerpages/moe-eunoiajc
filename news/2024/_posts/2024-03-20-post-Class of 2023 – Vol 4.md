<h3><strong>Eleanor Cheak</strong> (22-A5)</h3>
<p>Eleanor<strong> </strong>demonstrated unwavering commitment and strength
in her roles as Student Councillor and Vice-Captain of Akila house, embodying
servant leadership as she pursued her passion in Science and Technology
as part of the DSTA-JC Scholarship. Eleanor has been offered a conditional
Public Service Commission scholarship.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Who or what were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong>
</p>
<p>I have come to realise truly no one is a self made man, and in a school
with such a vibrant community, it is hard to pinpoint a specific person
or thing that fueled me over the last 2 years. However without a shadow
of doubt, given the different commitments piled high on my plate, if it
were not for them, I would not have made it here today. From my captains
Jing Bhin and Denzel who braved Akila's highest highs and lowest lows with
me, to Welfare, Euphoria and Council Camp committees with their support
and laughs while persevering through our various events, and my subject
and council teachers’ endless encouragement and consultation sessions -
these were just a few members of that vibrant community.</p>
<p>So I would say that the cliched tactics of time management, prioritising
and having passion for your commitments are indeed useful but they cannot
be compared to the kind of motivation and drive that stems from the people
around you. Canteen vendors piling food high during exam periods; long
rants with friends and teachers on the symposia floor; it was the reassurance
that we were all on this journey together, taking things one day at a time,
that motivated me to push through the 2 years.</p>
<p><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia you are grateful for?</strong>
</p>
<p>I will always be grateful that EJ gave us a space that allowed us to feel
safe in taking risks. Be it in the unwavering support from teachers, roars
of encouragement from peers, or the soft smiles along the corridors and
shoulders to cry on. In moments when I felt all had been lost because something
went wrong, the people around me reassured my efforts, never judged me
and made me feel so loved. Even though the world we are entering is not
nearly as forgiving, the little bit of kindness I experienced everyday
for 2 years made me brave enough to jump into the unknowns of student council,
captaincy and far-fetched opportunities and friendships, which makes saying
goodbye to my years of formal education almost easier, because I can leave
without any regrets. Thank you EJ, for teaching me what it means to have
strength in my vulnerabilities and to give so freely without expecting
anything in return. It was not an easy journey, but that made it all the
more incredible.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong>
</p>
<p>To the Class of 2023, we made it! Whether I cried on your shoulder after
Spartan or we’ve only exchanged a quick smile in the canteen, thank you
for being a part of the community that gave me so much peace and comfort
throughout these 2 years. With this day marking the end of our long arduous
A Level journey, I hope that your rank points do not define your JC journey.
Having seen each of us grow from the clueless J1s we were sleeping in lectures
to the people we are today, there is so much more to us and our journey
that a grade on a piece of paper cannot encapsulate. The fact that we are
standing here today is more than enough to be incredibly proud of.</p>
<p>To my juniors, write your own story. These 2 years will fly by so take
risks, allow yourself to grow and learn and do not let the expectations
placed upon you limit you. You each have so much to offer so define your
own yardstick of success and allow yourself to leave EJ without any regrets.</p>

<h3><strong>Ng Tian Xin Keana </strong>(22-O5)</h3>
<p>Keana's amazing all-round achievements and pursuits include: her passion
for Chinese language and culture, serving as President of the Bicultural
Studies Programme (BSP), and being a competitive boxer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Who or what were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong>
</p>
<p>My greatest source of motivation is definitely my close friends who were
there for me during my most stressful times in JC. Everyone has multiple
commitments. For me they were my academic studies as a student, training
as an athlete, and leading as BSP President. I am extremely grateful for
the support I have received from my peers. Emotional support from my friends
kept me on an even keel, and practical guidance when I was facing difficulties
helped see me through JC.</p>
<p><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia you would like to keep with you?</strong>
</p>
<p>I am grateful for the endless opportunities EJ gave us to allow us to
explore our interests and develop ourselves to our fullest potential. From
external competitions to leadership positions and in-campus programmes,
we were constantly exposed to various options. The countless emails we
received in the course of 2 years is proof of the hard work of teachers
and staff who put in time and effort to collate information for us, so
that we never run out of resources. I really appreciate the encouragement
given to all of us, to push us to excel in our own unique ways.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong>
</p>
<p>Study hard, of course, but also enjoy your time in EJ as much as possible.
Keep on exploring - you will realise that the world is much bigger than
you had imagined, and you will have many many more goals in life. Always
challenge yourself, in academics or in every other way, and believe that
every circumstance you are in is a stepping stone to improvement and eventual
success. Remember to trust yourself; all the best!</p>

<h3><strong>Jaden Tan </strong>(22-O5)</h3>
<p>Jaden dedicated himself to his musical pursuits in the Music Elective
Programme, attaining excellence while sharing the joy of music with others
and helping others develop their musical talents.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Who or what were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong>
</p>
<p>As music is a subject I care deeply about, the music teachers in Eunoia
have always been amazing role models I look up to. The amount of wisdom
they have and their dedication to guide the music students is something
I will always find admirable. Outside of regular lessons, I sometimes found
myself having a quick bite with them in the canteen, and talking about
other things not so academically related. At times, they would introduce
me to other forms of music and also give me new insights. This allowed
me to open up to many other forms of music and helped me gain a deeper
understanding into how I should perceive music as a subject.</p>
<p>Through the many consultations that I have with them, they did not just
fix my mistakes or misconceptions, but they went above and beyond to address
my insecurities, such as being unrealistically ambitious in my work, and
give me sound advice on how to tackle them. All in all, I would say that
my desire to improve myself for the better came directly from them, and
my experiences with them made me hungry to explore more about this subject
that I deeply care about.</p>
<p>Although I am now a graduate from Eunoia, I still regularly come back
to meet them for another quick bite, and every time they will teach me
more things that bring me back to my student days in EJ.</p>
<p><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia you would like to keep with you?</strong>
</p>
<p>The time I spent revising with my friends during our little group study
sessions will always be an experience I am grateful for.</p>
<p>Studying is often seen as an anxiety-ridden task, exacerbated by the stress
of the approaching A-Levels. However, studying with friends has always
felt so wholesome, because it makes the entire process of studying less
stressful. My friends and I always loved to banter with one another and
trade playful insults when discussing questions. Overall, we were having
a good time, and it really made me forget about all the stress that usually
comes with studying.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, my relationships with my friends was really
strengthened. Friendships are not just about sharing the good things, but
also going through tough times together. In the face of hardship, my friends
and I have made the most out of a stressful situation, and I think that
my time in EJ will probably be the only time that I get to go through such
a thing, which is why this is an experience I would like to keep with me.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong>
</p>
<p>The time I have spent on the Arts taught me that the idea of “perfection”
really doesn’t exist. It is something we all strive for, but something
impossible to achieve. There will always be something that we find not
up to our standards. It is a cold hard fact that we all should come to
terms with, but most of us are not fully ready to accept it, myself included.
<br>
</p>
<p>From this, I also realised that there exists a difference between striving
for perfection, and fearing imperfection. Just as there is a difference
between thinking your creation isn’t as good as it can be, and thinking
you are unable to create quality works. In everything you do in EJ or in
future, don’t doubt yourself, and above all, don’t let self-doubt hinder
your progress. Even if you think you are bad at doing something, it doesn’t
give you a good enough excuse to not do it. Push through A levels with
confidence!</p>

<h3><strong>Cheng Zhi Shan </strong>(22-U1)</h3>
<p>Zhi Shan was a stellar student and member of the Eunoia Humanities Programme
who has done the college proud!</p>

<p><strong>Who or what were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong>
</p>
<p>What kept me going throughout these 2 years were undeniably my friends
and teachers. On days when I felt like giving up, seeing the hard work
of my friends as they completed practice papers one after another and witnessing
the tireless efforts of my teachers as they rushed to mark and return supplementary
worksheets were moments that truly got me through the more lethargic days.
The words of encouragement from my friends, be it as simple as the occasional
‘jiayous’, as well as the patience and guidance that my teachers endlessly
offered, became my pillars of support I never knew I needed. To my subject
tutors especially, I would not have come this far were it not for their
constant assurance that there were people who continued to believe in us
- people who were willing to go the extra mile to help us achieve our dreams
- that knowledge became one of my greatest sources of motivation.</p>
<p><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia you would like to keep with you?</strong>
</p>
<p>I will forever treasure the sense of community I felt in EJ, a feeling
I have never really experienced anywhere else. I am truly glad and proud
to call EJ my second home as the memories and friendships I have made will
surely last a lifetime. This would not have been possible without my class,
22-U1. I still remember our first class party; how we went crazy during
Euphoria; the multiple rehearsals we had for our Litfest showcase; and
the tireless mugging at level 9 consult areas. Moments like these really
helped to build the strong sense of belonging I felt in EJ as me and my
peers rejoiced in the highs and weathered the storms together. I continue
to cherish this feeling in my heart and am forever grateful that life has
given me the opportunity to cross paths with some of the kindest, funniest,
and sweetest people I know today.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong>
</p>
<p>To my batch, we have done a REALLY good job! We are truly amazing for
having persevered through these two years in JC and we should all be proud
of the effort we have put in. Through all the laughter and tears, completing
this two year journey is already a feat in itself, so let’s give ourselves
a pat on the back because we deserve it. Alongside that, thank you so much
for having grown with me and for all the precious memories we have made.
I would not have wanted to experience JC any other way and could not be
more blessed for these short two years I have had with y'all.</p>
<p>To my juniors, the road ahead may seem daunting, the “finishing line”
may seem far away, and believe me when I say there will be times when you
feel like just giving up. But trust me when I say as well, the days do
and will get easier. Don’t be afraid to take that first step forward, be
it asking for more consults or reaching out for extra guidance. It may
not be easy but it is definitely worth it. No step taken is ever too small,
so be proud of whatever you have set out to accomplish and ALL THE BEST
in achieving them! Jiayou! You can do it!</p>
