<h3><strong>Christie Sardjono </strong>(22-U1)</h3>
<p>Student Council President, Humanities Scholar, H3 Literature student,
leader, organiser, ardent dancer, emcee and friend — Christie from the
Class of 2023 can shine in any role but her kindness, passion and dedication
are what all of us in Eunoia know her for. She shares with us some of her
precious memories and words of wisdom.</p>
<h6>WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EJC?</h6>
<p>The people I met in EJC are the reasons why my time here has been so special.
Over the past two years, I’ve been blessed to cross paths with the most
passionate, kind and selfless people I’ve ever met. From the breaks I’ve
spent with my class in the canteen, the tireless nights with the 6th Student
Council preparing for our events, the consultations my teachers have given
me (on both academics and life) to the passing conversations along the
corridors, Eunoia’s community is what has made this place my second home,
and gifted me with friendships which I believe can last a lifetime.</p>
<h6>WHAT IS ONE EXPERIENCE, FEELING OR IDEA FROM YOUR TIME IN EJ YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WITH YOU, OR ARE GRATEFUL FOR?</h6>
<p>The feeling of adrenaline that comes the moment a college dance song plays
never gets old. I will always treasure the camaraderie and energy coursing
through the Eunoia community whenever we come together, no matter where
we are or who we are standing next to.</p>
<h6>WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THE CLASS OF 2023 AND YOUR JUNIORS?</h6>
<p>I hope we can bring the spirit of Eunoia with us wherever we go, daring
to dream big, and always taking the courage to turn those dreams into reality.
I believe that the past two years have brought us through the most exhilarating
and fulfilling journey of self-discovery, and no matter where life takes
us, Eunoia will always be there as a space and community for us to look
towards.
<br>
</p>
<p>To the Class of 2024 and beyond, keep the spirit of Eunoia alive and embrace
every chance you get to discover something new. The Eunoia community is
incredibly special, so treasure each moment you have with your friends
and teachers, and always remember to be there for one another!</p>

<h3><strong>Wong Kenzo </strong>(22-E3)</h3>
<p>Kenzo was crowned Prom King last year and he was no less majestic for
his humility and service to Eunoia and his fellow Eunoians. As a dancer,
ambassador and all-round student, Kenzo brought care and charisma to everything
he did and everything he hopes his juniors in Eunoia will do.</p>
<p></p>
<h6>WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EJC?</h6>
<p>The most meaningful part of my journey in Eunoia undoubtedly revolves
around the honour of being crowned Prom King. However, the true significance
lies not in the title or the glory but in the profound support I received
from my classmates and CCA. It was only with their unwavering encouragement
that moved me to take the leap of faith and run for Prom King in the first
place. Without the backing of my 'campaign team', I might never have considered
vying for the title, making the glory theirs to share as well. The sense
of trust, camaraderie, and unity that emerged from this experience has
been instrumental in my personal growth. It boosted my confidence, taught
me the value of genuine connections, and deepened my sense of belonging
within the Eunoia community. This not only left me with cherished memories
but has also exemplified the importance of shared support and trust in
making meaningful strides in life.</p>
<h6>WHAT IS ONE EXPERIENCE, FEELING OR IDEA FROM YOUR TIME IN EJ YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WITH YOU, OR ARE GRATEFUL FOR?</h6>
<p>Leaving Eunoia, a term as novel as the school itself, encompasses more
than simply a departure; it signifies the transition to new chapters in
our lives. What I will cherish are not just the lessons learned and exams
conquered but a profound sense of eunoia — a beautiful mind cultivated
through the unique experiences of camaraderie, compassion, and comfort.
Within my CCA, Dance, the collective pursuit of excellence and the shared
triumphs forged bonds that are more than simple friendships. Witnessing
genuine compassion among friends has fostered a new perspective that I
carry into the future. And amidst academic rigours and personal challenges,
Eunoia provided a comforting sanctuary, nurturing holistic development
and fostering a sense of shared responsibility in cultivating an inclusive
community. As I embark on new adventures beyond the school gates, these
three pillars of eunoia—camaraderie, compassion, and comfort—remain unwavering
constants. They are intangible treasures, anchoring me to the essence of
my Eunoia experience.</p>
<h6>WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THE CLASS OF 2023 AND YOUR JUNIORS?</h6>
<p>To my juniors, take every opportunity you can. Take every leap of faith
and trust in yourself. You will never know when an opportunity will be
presented in front of you again. Leave Eunoia having new experiences, instead
of new regrets over missed opportunities!</p>

<h3><strong>Wong En-Si </strong>(22-O4)</h3>
<p>En-Si<strong> </strong>was a Class Chairperson with a heart for her peers
and a member of Service Learning Club who went the extra mile to volunteer
at many beneficiaries. All of her tutors see in her a true thinker with
heart embodying beautiful thinking, goodwill to all.</p>
<h6>WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EJC?</h6>
<p>The most meaningful part of my journey would be the sense of togetherness
I’ve experienced with my classmates. Coming from the JAE pathway, I initially
struggled during JC1 Orientation as I felt isolated and distant. However,
the worry that I would take a long time to settle proved to be unfounded.
Very quickly, my classmates became one of my strongest support pillars
throughout this JC journey. The silly jokes we’d spill to relieve stress,
the quiet study sessions we’d have during breaks, and the daily class lunches
we’d make time for, all built a palpable sense of community and mutual
help. Things weren’t always easy and there were times of tension within
ourselves too. Nonetheless, I thank God for all these experiences that
my classmates and I had while plodding through JC life together as they
have helped me to grow so much. It is the memories of these experiences,
much more than all the studying, that will remain firmly etched in my mind.</p>
<h6>WHAT IS ONE EXPERIENCE, FEELING OR IDEA FROM YOUR TIME IN EJ YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WITH YOU, OR ARE GRATEFUL FOR?</h6>
<p>I really appreciate the sense of support that I’ve experienced from my
teachers in EJ. Though it was tough at times, the knowledge that my teachers
were ever willing to help was comforting. I am especially thankful for
the Life Coaching programme. Through it, I’ve been able to verbalise my
confusion, hear different perspectives, and receive highly personal and
applicable advice. Beyond merely providing career guidance or coping techniques,
my life coach sought to listen to whatever was on my mind, before slowly
working out concrete action plans with me. Our ideas and values are not
identical. Yet, simply having someone willing to talk me through the various
issues was in itself a huge support as it enabled me to navigate JC in
a clearer light. As such, I’m thankful to my life coach, Ms Rachel Yau,
for taking the time off her extremely busy schedule countless times to
meet me. Her ready help, alongside those of all my other teachers, has
immensely contributed to the support I’ve experienced throughout these
two years and I am very grateful for it.</p>
<h6>WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THE CLASS OF 2023 AND YOUR JUNIORS?</h6>
<p>To the Class of 2023, congratulations on completing the short but arduous
journey! To the juniors, all the best as you trod through!
<br>
</p>
<p>Whatever phase we are at, there will be difficulties – both within the
academic realm and beyond. Don’t be afraid to reach out for support! There
are so many people around us in Eunoia keen to help us but there is only
so much they can do if we are not open to it. So book consults, have life
coaching sessions, speak to teachers or friends with whom you are comfortable,
and share your life with your family! And when you’ve benefited from their
support, remember to reciprocate, supporting others in return. There are
difficulties others face that we do not see on the surface, and sometimes
all they need is to know that someone cares. If we would all support each
other a little more and seek support a little more, both JC and the world
beyond would become more meaningful.</p>
