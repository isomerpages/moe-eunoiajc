<h3><strong>Charlotte  Lee </strong>(22-I2)</h3>
<p>An outstanding Netball captain who continually strove for improvement,
Charlotte Lee led by example both within and outside the classroom.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Who or what were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong>
</p>
<p>“Home is where the people are.” I guess coming into EJ, I could finally
understand this quote and truly relate to it. Eunoia is my second home.
Through EJ, I have gotten the chance to cross paths with some of the most
amazing people, be it my peers or my tutors. These people have been my
pillars of support throughout these two years, being the reason I could
stay motivated and keep going. It was not simply the “Jiayou(s)” and small
encouragement snacks that gave me a boost; it was the feeling of camaraderie
and trust with them that allowed me to know I was not alone. At the hardest
times when I felt defeated or when I almost wanted to give up, the faith
that my tutors and peers had in me gave me strength to persevere. They
gave me a reason to smile and tell myself that it was not the end!</p>
<p>Taking up multiple commitments in EJ, I had a busy time, but it was truly
exhilarating. Looking back, I have no regrets and, certainly, enjoying
what I was doing really helped give me motivation to carry on! I found
reasons to love and appreciate, like the strength of journeying together
as a team, or bonding with a community of incredible individuals in my
house (Isami!). Hence, alongside practising time management and maintaining
consistency in order to juggle my responsibilities, I think viewing these
responsibilities as wonderful memorable experiences I had the opportunity
to journey through made them a source of joy instead of a burden.</p>
<h6><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia are you grateful for?</strong></h6>
<p>I am wholeheartedly grateful to Eunoia, for allowing me to experience
the true beauty of “work hard, play hard”. This idea is not one that was
new or foreign to me before, but I never really got to experience it at
such a deep level until I came to EJ.</p>
<p>Through Eunoia, I was given the chance to feel the highest ‘highs’ despite
the stressful journey. Each school event brought me euphoria and I was
enjoying each moment to the fullest, with my heart feeling warm and full
after! Being gifted with such times of relief made it much easier to spend
time with our heads in the books. It helped me manage stress much more
easily while coping with my commitments and academics. Stepping out of
EJ, this feeling of fulfilment and achievement is one that grants me the
ability to say that I have no regrets. I am grateful for each and every
individual I have met here, and every opportunity I was given to live my
Eunoian life to the fullest. Thank you EJ, for letting my dreams take flight!</p>
<h6><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong></h6>
<p>To my batchmates, I want to say Congratulations! We made it! Two years
ago, when we first entered Eunoia, some of us could never have pictured
how the next two years of our lives would play out. Now that it’s over,
we can look back on the memories we have made, friendships forged, and
challenges we’ve overcome, using them as our sources of motivation for
the journey ahead of us.</p>
<p>To the new J1s, I hope you will make this EJ experience uniquely yours!
Take risks and try new things, meet new people and form networks, and make
every moment count.</p>
<p>Lastly to the current J2s, do not forget to let yourself breathe every
once in a while, and enjoy this final year in Eunoia. Even though A levels
may seem daunting and scary, be brave, stay consistent and remember to
rest! To quote EJ Netball’s team motto, keep striving and giving it your
all “to the end”. EU-GOT THIS!</p>

<h3><strong>Elysa Wu </strong>(22-E2)</h3>
<p>Amidst the stress of academic pursuits and other expectations, Elysa's
journey of resilience and growth provides inspiration and points to the
power of gratitude.</p>
<p></p>
<h6><strong>What is one struggle that you faced, and how did you overcome it?</strong></h6>
<p>One struggle I faced consistently throughout my JC journey was my battle
with anxiety. I have always been very hard on myself, striving to achieve
stellar grades that could live up to my own expectations. In my own eyes,
failure was not an option; my best was to give a 110+% effort, nothing
less.</p>
<p>Overcoming anxiety is a life-long journey I have yet to overcome. Nevertheless,
I can say that I am now better able to cope with it. I learnt that building
connections with people is vital. Reaching out to my closest friends in
EJ as well as to my teachers really helped me persevere to the end. I learnt
to be courageous: firstly to be honest with myself, to share my struggles
and to seek help. Not only was I able to receive care and support from
the people around me, but I was also able to acknowledge what I was going
through and process my feelings in a healthy manner.</p>
<p>Moreover, I learnt the importance of understanding, accepting and loving
myself. For example, I know when to tell myself that I have done enough
studying for the day and it is time to rest; I would remind myself that
I’m not defined by my grades; and I would seek out friends who can accept
me for who I am. These were some self-care steps I practised to better
manage my emotions as a worrywart.</p>
<h6><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia are you grateful for?</strong></h6>
<h6>I would always keep with me a sense of appreciation and gratitude towards my EJ teachers and friends who had shown such love and care to me, especially during my lowest moments. </h6>
<p>I am grateful that my EJ teachers care more about who I am than what I
can achieve. My form teacher, Mr Ng Boon Hong, had never failed to reach
out and check in on me. He supported and believed in me. I also want to
thank my co-form teacher, Mr Kelvin Teo, who set aside time to chat with
me one-to-one, to advise and counsel me, imparting his practical wisdom.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am also grateful that I found true friends in EJ who sincerely
cared about my well-being. They did not judge me when I shared with them
my personal struggles but respected me and stood up for me all the time.
They were there to listen to my deepest worries and helped bear my burdens.</p>
<p>The greatest lesson I took away from my time in Eunoia is gratitude.</p>
<h6><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong></h6>
<p>To my fellow batchmates: all the best for your university endeavours and
future career! May you treasure all the wonderful memories you have made
in EJ and be able to apply the lessons you have learnt to whatever you
decide to do in future. I hope that all of you will achieve the goals you
desire, continue to mature as individuals, and be a positive influence
to those around you.</p>
<p>To my juniors, JC life may be the toughest period of your educational
journey, but hard work, discipline and resilience are key values that can
guide you through. As long as you stay consistent and focused in all your
subjects, prioritising time to rest when needed, I am confident that you
will be able to carve out a unique, enriching EJ experience for yourself,
and ultimately graduate as a much stronger and more confident individual.

<h3><strong>Daniel Ong </strong>(22-O1)</h3>
<p>Daniel was a dedicated student of the Eunoia Humanities Programme, a member
of the Student Council and also received the President’s Scout Award. He
shares some of his highlights of his time in Eunoia and advice for current
Eunoians.</p>
<p></p>
<h6><strong>Who were your great sources of motivation? How did you manage to balance your commitments?</strong></h6>
<p>Without a doubt, the community of friends and family that I had in Eunoia
played a big role in keeping me going. Everywhere I turned, be it in Council,
class or Scouts, I had an incredibly supportive community that believed
in me even in times when I did not believe in myself.</p>
<p>Another of my greatest motivators was really my younger self. In my character
and morals, attitude towards challenges, effort in school and elsewhere,
and the kind of friend and leader I was, I wanted to be someone that little
Daniel would be proud of. This motivated me to put in my best effort and
truly learn and grow to become a better person.</p>
<p>I made sure to manage my time well, and the first stem was deciding what
was important to me. After that, putting in that time and effort into what
I cared about while cutting back from things that were not as significant
came more naturally. It truly is all about prioritising and learning how
to say ‘No, thank you’!</p>
<h6><strong>What is one experience, feeling or idea from your time in Eunoia are you grateful for?</strong></h6>
<p>I am definitely grateful for the autonomy that I was entrusted with as
a leader. I came into Student Council expecting more rigid and formal operating
procedures. When I realised how much our teachers trusted us and gave us
the independence to make important decisions, it made me more invested
in my projects, motivating me to put in my very best.</p>
<p>Of course, there were mistakes made along the way - but these setbacks
taught me humility and allowed me to grow to become a better leader. My
teachers stood by me all the time, supporting me to transform missteps
into stepping stones towards achievements. I am thus thankful for the teachers
who never gave up on me, who instead continued to have faith and genuinely
cared for me every step of the way.</p>
<h6><strong>What would you like to say to the Class of 2023 and your juniors?</strong></h6>
<p>To my batchmates, as we all move to different stages of our lives, I hope
that we will be able to look back and reflect on who we were when we first
entered Eunoia, and regardless of our grades, we will be able to acknowledge
how much we have grown in this time. Be it in friendships, passion or character,
we have all gained so much.</p>
<p>To my juniors, I would encourage you to always try, for even in failure
there is so much to learn. I too am afraid of failing and wasting effort,
but we will never know what we can achieve if we never first try. I did
not make it into my secondary school’s Student Council, but I grew from
that as a person and leader, eventually succeeding in leadership later
on. Our failures can be difficult and scary, but the only way forward is
to have hope in a brighter future.</p>
