**Dear Parents and Alumni,**

Allow me to begin by going back in time. In October 2016, our Mount Sinai campus saw its first glimpse of student life at a gathering of our then-Year 4 Joint Integrated Programme students. The assortment of colours grew when we welcomed our Eunoians from the Joint Admissions Exercise in February 2017 to complete our first class of students. So much of the college, from the cheers that reach our neighbours in Ghim Moh to the ineffable pride that has reached deep into our third cohort, started from those incipient meetings. It felt almost strange in the first weeks of the year to _not_ see the familiar faces of our pioneering cohort each morning, studying at the Atria benches, painting banners or running around the campus.

## First Going Forward

The hall and canteen at our Mount Sinai campus reside in a block we have named Concordia. The Latin word means harmony, translating literally to ‘with heart’. It is perhaps apt that we welcomed some members of our first class – whom we can now call our alumni – in the heart of our school at a few points in Term 1. The campfire at our Orientation finale burned stronger with our past student councillors and orientation group leaders watching on. Some of them also joined us to _lou hei_ at our Chinese New Year Celebrations. Just the day before the release of the A-Level results, many more came back with strong hands and big hearts to help us pack goodie bags full of higher education and scholarship collaterals for their own batchmates. After the results were released, we saw many Eunoians return to the college once again with gifts and cards to thank their teachers. The joy at seeing our alumni come back goes together with seeing their passion and thoughtfulness after they have left the college. We thank our alumni for keeping Eunoia close to their hearts and minds and hope to see many more of them return home, whether at our current campus or in Bishan.

The day the A-Level results were released gave us very many reasons for celebration. Seeing our ladies and gentlemen, some in uniform and clean heads, a little more mature with three months’ worth of adventures and work experience under their belt was one. Another was their stellar academic performance as a cohort, both a capstone to their all-round achievement and contributions as pioneers and a milestone for the Eunoia community. Their stories of resilience, from overcoming personal and social challenges, confronting their fears and mistakes, and working together with their peers and teachers, will inspire their juniors and a full generation ahead of them. Their can-do spirit is a part of the Eunoia DNA. We now know that every Eunoian has the potential to shine in the sporting arena, the performance stage, community engagement and academic pursuits.

With even brighter paths ahead of them, we remain keenly interested in their growth after junior college: our gentlemen will set purposeful milestones in national service, and our Eunoians will be receiving offers from universities and scholarship boards. We have been elated to learn that many are likely to take on courses they are passionate about locally and in Peking, Oxford, King’s, Imperial, UCL, Virginia amongst many other overseas institutions. To our first alumni, let’s keep in touch and do come back to share your experiences with your juniors!

## Gift of the Present

Our JC2s have themselves shone as Eunoians who take pride in their identity and rise to the occasion. The finale at our open house, where hundreds gathered at our Atria for a rapturous batch dance, particularly made our hearts sing and our eyes water a little. At Eunite and EJC Orientation, we saw our second cohort of students stepping up with youthful purpose, heart and courage to lead our JC1 Eunoians. Behind the games, races and cheers, our student-leaders and orientation group leaders have put in a remarkable amount of effort and thought, and we imagine that this experience, igniting the fire within their juniors and themselves, stay with them and push them to shine in their 2019 journey.

The fruit of their labour is already presenting itself. News of our Aesthetics groups and athletes’ achievements at the Singapore Youth Festival and National School Games is coming in week by week, a culmination of their intensive rehearsals and training alongside their scholastic preparations for the JC2 March Common Test and continual assessment for our JC1s. Just as important are the strong friendships they build and the memories they forge during the toughest of periods. Even as juniors and seniors look to each other for possibilities and direction, let them remember that the obstacles they encounter and the difficulties they work through will help them grow into bigger, braver versions of themselves.

Taking on the mantle as seniors, our JC2s can be confident of themselves and their contributions to the world around them. Our Global Orientation Programme in 2018 gave them the opportunity to explore and immerse themselves in new communities in China, Taiwan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom. It is our desire that they regard service to others as a part of their daily life. At our most recent Deep Dive Day, our entire cohort embarked on different service projects in Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Admiralty, Punggol and Ghim Moh, and their interactions with our senior citizens would have given them much to cherish and learn. This being our last year situated at Mount Sinai, we hope to see our Eunoians continue giving back to the neighboring Ghim Moh community and find meaning in doing so.

## Raising the Future

Each new year of the college’s short history has given us new opportunities for which we are thankful. Mr Adrian Tay joined us as Deputy Principal at the end of 2018, having served stints at the Ministry of Law and Ministry of Education and led as a pioneering Head of Department at Crest Secondary School. Our third cohort of students, already invigorated in their houses and civics groups from their Orientation, will soon be taking up leadership responsibilities and take the college to greater heights. The construction of our Bishan campus too has been progressing steadily, with the academic block nearing completion. Our architects have presented to us some of the spaces our Eunoians will be able to learn, train and interact in. Drive past Marymount Road or take a walk at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, and you will have a good view of the possibilities that await us. We hope to share with you more photos of the campus from the inside as soon as we can.

## A Home for All

To make our Bishan campus truly a home for all, we are raising funds for the air-conditioning of our new multi-purpose hall. This is not a standard provision by the ministry, and the college has embarked on a series of fundraising efforts including our upcoming [**College Day Concert**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/ltw19/). This joint performance by our five Aesthetics CCA groups – the Eunoia Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Dance, Drama and Symphonic Band – is accompanied by several more of our talented Eunoians’ artwork and musical items. We invite you to join us at the University Cultural Centre Hall on 11 May 2019 as well as our Funfair and Unconference at our Mount Sinai campus on 20 July 2019.

The next term promises to be a most exciting and intense one for our Eunoians, as the Singapore Youth Festival and National School Games seasons kick in and progressively higher academic demands come their way. With your continued support, may they light the way forward as leaders, thinkers and youth with purpose.

**Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng**  
Principal
