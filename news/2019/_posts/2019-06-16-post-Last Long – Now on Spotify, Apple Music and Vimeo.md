'Last Long', a song written by Deputy Principal Mr Adrian Tay and performed by Karis Goh (18-A3) and Donavan Bay (17-E5), was launched on Eunoia Junior College's third College Day.

The music video was produced by a team of JC2 Eunoians from EJC Media Club, and the track was produced and arranged by Daniel Wong of [**Ardant Studio**](https://www.facebook.com/ardant.studio/).

The song captures the friendships of our pioneering cohorts and some of the memories they made at our Mount Sinai campus in 2017 and 2018.

##### LYRICS

Doesn’t seem, really doesn’t seem so long ago  
When I looked at you, you looked at me, and then we said “Hello”  
I used to wonder why, wonder why growing up felt so slow  
But now it seems the years have just flown by  
What did we know?

Remember the time we stayed up all night?  
Remember the time we had that fight?  
The memories we made I don’t want them to fade  
The joys and regrets   
I’ll never forget

Laughing so hard that the tears came falling  
In and out of love so many times I’m going  
Crazy that’s the way you drive me  
Just by being you  
This is our song!  
Minute after minute the clock keeps ticking  
On towards an end where there’s a new beginning  
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?  
The question we’re all asking is  
Will we last long?  
Will we last long?

Through it all, through the ups and downs we stood by each other  
I’ve got your back and you’ve got mine – rain or shine, whatever the weather  
We said that we, said that we would be best friends forever  
And even though this chapter’s done  
Our story isn’t over

Remember the time we played in the rain?  
Remember the time we lost that game?  
The memories we made I don’t want them to fade  
The joys and regrets   
I’ll never forget

Laughing so hard that the tears came falling  
In and out of love so many times I’m going  
Crazy that’s the way you drive me  
Just by being you  
This is our song!  
Minute after minute the clock keeps ticking  
On towards an end where there’s a new beginning  
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?  
The question we’re all asking is  
Will we last

Laughing so hard that the tears came falling  
In and out of love so many times I’m going  
Crazy that’s the way you drive me  
Just by being you  
This is our song!  
Minute after minute the clock keeps ticking  
On towards an end where there’s a new beginning  
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?  
The answer to our question is  
We will last long!  
We will last long!

Doesn’t seem, really doesn’t seem so long ago
