### A Truly First Class Performance

Eunoia Junior College congratulates our First Class of students for their outstanding achievement at the 2018 GCE A-Level Examination. Coming together from the Joint Integrated Programme, Direct School Admission and Joint Admissions Exercise pathways, they have shone brightly as the change makers and pioneers of the college. They have truly made history and created a great legacy for their juniors to carry forward.

The college is extremely proud of all 529 Eunoians who sat the 2018 GCE A-Level Examination. 1 in 2 Eunoians attained at least 3 H2 distinctions, with 1 in 3 scoring 5 distinctions or more and 94 Eunoians scoring 6 distinctions or more. In addition, 1 in 2 students achieved a distinction in their H3 subjects. The cohort achieved a median University Admissions Score (UAS) of 85 rank points.

Our combined total of 80 scholars from the Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese), Humanities Scholarship Programme and Music Elective Programme, our MOE Pre-University Scholars, international scholars, book prize and scholarship recipients have set a tradition of excellence for the college with their stellar results.

Amongst the many milestones for our first cohort, our Eunoians have to date received conditional offers from distinguished institutions including Oxford University and Peking University, and provisional offers of scholarships such as the Public Service Commission scholarship and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Defence Merit Scholarship. The college eagerly anticipates more good news from our Eunoians in the coming months.

### Brightness and Splendour

Above and beyond their lustrous academic results, every Eunoian from our First Class has excelled holistically as a Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart and Leader with Courage. Within a few months of intensive practice, our inaugural cohort of performing arts CCAs clinched the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2017 in the Dance and Concert Band categories. This was followed by another outstanding showing in Drama at the SYF Arts Presentation in 2018. Our student-athletes represented Singapore at the Asian Youth Games and ASEAN School Games, while also attaining a very commendable 2nd and 3rd place in the ‘A’ Division Hockey (Girls) and Netball championships in 2018. In various academic competitions and olympiads, our Eunoians also paved the way in our first years to even greater successes and wins in the near future. Most importantly, our First Class served as writers of the Eunoia story, handing over a school culture future generations of Eunoians are proud to call their own.

### A Beautiful Journey

Mrs Kellie Woo, the Dean of our 2018 JC2 cohort, shared her heartfelt thoughts, ‘I am extremely proud of our pioneering cohort, who have been with Eunoia every step of the journey, some from as early as 2013. From being orientation leaders for their own batch to starting CCAs from scratch, they truly created Eunoia's legacy. The First Class indeed holds a very special place in all our hearts. Today we not only celebrate their holistic achievements but also the Eunoia identity that they have created.'

Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng, Principal, added, ‘We are proud of our Eunoians’ achievements and all-rounded development. The A-Level result is but one step in the lifelong learning journey of our pioneer students. In many ways their growth and development have been defined by the college culture they have pioneered, the college spirit they have fostered, the friendships they have built, and the cognitive sharpness they have developed. While their A-Level results open doors to possibilities in their next journey, they are ultimately not defined by their grades and certificates but by who they are as a person and what impact they leave on others.’

As one Eunoia, we celebrate the holistic achievements and contributions of our First Class. The college would like to extend its deepest gratitude to our teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, our College Advisory Committee, Joint Integrated Programme partner schools and all who have made the Eunoia dream a reality. May our First Class spread their beautiful thinking and goodwill far and wide, and shine brightly as thinkers, leaders, and Eunoians forevermore.
