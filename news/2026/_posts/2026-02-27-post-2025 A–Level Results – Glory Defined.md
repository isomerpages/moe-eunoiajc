<p>Eunoia Junior College congratulates our Class of 2025 for their holistic
achievements at the 2025 Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Examination. The
college is proud of all 705 Eunoians, having done themselves proud in at
the National School Games and the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
in 2024 and 2025, making a positive impact on the community and the environment
with school-based and self-initiated projects, and always showing beautiful
thinking, goodwill to all.</p>

<p><strong>Mr Andrew Tan</strong>, our Principal, shared his message to the
Class of 2025: "You have been an amazing batch and have brought so much
to everything you do – your passion, your many talents, your energy, your
compassion. These results are part of that larger picture of who you are.
As I shared just before you collected your results, do remember three things.
First, regardless of what results you got – celebrate and be grateful for
the journey, the learning and the friendships you have made, be grateful
to those who have journeyed with you. Second, remember that you are so
much more than the letters or numbers on that certificate – our dreams,
purpose and passion matter. Third, be open to the opportunities and choices
you have – even and maybe especially the ones you never considered or thought
of before. It has been my absolute privilege and pleasure to have been
part of your life these last two years – stay in touch always!"</p>

<p><strong>Ms Michelle Chiang</strong>, Dean for the Class of 2025, added,
"It has been a real privilege to watch you grow, laugh, learn and support
one another through these two years. Each of you has left your own mark
on Eunoia, and the college is richer because of you. Your journey has been
marked by courage, growth and resilience, and we are so proud of who you
have become. As you step into new beginnings, know that we will be cheering
you on every step of the way."</p>

<p>The growth and achievements of our Eunoians would not be possible without
the dedication and support of teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, alumni,
College Advisory Committee, our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools
and our many industry and community partners. To the Class of 2025, may
your dreams take flight!</p>
