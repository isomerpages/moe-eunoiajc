Shortly after my A-Levels, I had the opportunity to work as a relief teacher. The brief but meaningful exposure encouraged me to apply for MOE Teaching Award and pursue Chemistry in university. I graduated from the National University of Singapore with Bachelor of Science in Chemistry.

Prior to joining the Eunoia family, I taught chemistry in a junior college from 2004 to 2017 and served as the Subject Head for Chemistry there from 2011 to 2017. Beyond academic programmes, I had various opportunities to lead students and teachers in different platforms such as student leadership, Dance CCA, aesthetics education, staff performances, fundraising and the Deans’ Committee as Deputy Dean.

These valuable experiences have been congruent with my teaching and work philosophy. Creating a vibrant and positive school culture does not depend solely on students but also on teachers’ and other stakeholders’ active participation. Joining Eunoia in 2018 is an exciting prospect for me as I hope that I will be able to contribute in shaping a unique culture and creating a dynamic learning environment in Eunoia.

In my free time, I like to cook, bake, dance and draw.
