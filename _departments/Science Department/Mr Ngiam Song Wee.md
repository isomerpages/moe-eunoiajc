I completed my Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) in Physics with a Minor in Chemistry and a Minor in Mathematics from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2011. I was fortunate to be awarded the Lee Kuan Yew Gold Medal and the Koh Boon Hwee Scholars Award for my academic and holistic performance. Personally, I am more heartened to have received the Teaching Award from NTU’s School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences for serving as a teaching assistant to an undergraduate course in Solid State Physics.

After a fruitful experience working with Senior High students in a school offering the Integrated Programme, I broadened my perspective on our educational landscape in MOE’s Planning Division as a Policy Officer. Subsequently, an Assistant Directorship with MINDEF afforded a valuable understanding of Singapore’s needs for indigenous talents in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), for both the defence and civilian sectors. My interactions with MINDEF counterparts, the scientists at the DSO National Laboratories, the engineers at the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and other colleagues in public service agencies such as GovTech, reaffirmed my passion for educating our future generation.

I firmly believe in developing talent not only in the STEM disciplines, but pivoting towards STEAM – in recognition that the Arts will necessarily and increasingly be intertwined with technological progress. Nurturing future leaders with a deep appreciation of both the arts and sciences will be crucial to Singapore’s journey towards becoming a Smart Nation. To that, I am glad to be part of Eunoia Junior College as it is well-placed to do so, due to our emphasis on helping our students pursue all-round excellence.
