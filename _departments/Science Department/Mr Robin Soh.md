I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics from the National University of Singapore (NUS). In 2008, I went on to pursue a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education. On top of that, I obtained a Diploma in Information Technology and am currently pursuing a Specialist Diploma in Mobile Applications.

As a Junior College teacher, I was the chief internal moderator for the School-based Practical Assessments (SPA) and built up effective structures for SPA administration. I also led my previous college’s Science club in various competitions clinching several top medals and school challenge trophies such as the Amazing Science-X Challenge organised by the Singapore Science Centre, NUS and DSO National Laboratories. I was also one of the coaches who trained the teams that represented Singapore at the Asian and International Physics Olympiads.

I hold fast to Jean Piaget’s belief that “the principal goal of education is to create men who are capable of doing new things, not simply of repeating what other generations have done.” Education involves the acquisition of knowledge but it does not stop there. What we can do with the knowledge that we acquire is truly limitless and I believe this is where education takes flight. Innovation drives the world that we live in today. It is the essential 21st-century skill that gets our creative juices flowing.
