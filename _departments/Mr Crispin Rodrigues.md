I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature (Second Upper Honours) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and obtained a Masters of Arts (Second Upper Honours) in English Literature from the same university under the NTU research scholarship. My research interests focused mostly on modern American literature and philosophy, as well as contemporary American poetry. My academic background has given me opportunities to deliver papers at international conferences and rub shoulders with notable scholars and award-winning authors.

I then taught first-year English Literature students in a university for almost two years before embarking on a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Junior College) at the National Institute of Education in 2016. This teaching stint served as an important moment in affirming my belief in education and using teaching as a medium to inculcate interest and passion in my students.

I strongly believe that General Paper allows students to understand the world around them, and in the process of discussing local and global issues, they learn to be concerned citizens and active contributors to civil discourse, resonating with the college vision of ‘Every Eunoian a Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage’. I also believe that the classroom teaching and learning empowers students with perspective and insights such that they learn to empathise with those in vastly different circumstances from themselves and understand the human condition.

Outside of teaching, I am a published poet and spoken word performer, and have organised literary events on the university and national level. My greatest joy is to help inspire a new generation of creative and articulate writers who will master the art of writing and speaking, as well as to muster the courage and will to challenge and invigorate the world around themselves.
