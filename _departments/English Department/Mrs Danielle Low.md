I was awarded a Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours, majoring in Political Science, by the National University of Singapore.

My career as a teacher began in a junior college, where I taught General Paper (GP). There, I contributed in the creation and delivery of a range of GP programmes. Having an interest in developing student leaders, I had joined the Students’ Council as a teacher in-charge. Subsequently, I went on to become the second in-charge (IC) of the Council and then the overall IC. I also assisted in leading a team of teachers to guide students in running an annual Open House event, and similarly led such a team in an annual Orientation for first year students. Following my passion for choral music, I also joined the Choir teacher team where I contributed in the planning of the Choir curriculum and guided students for Choir performances. I was also part of a newly created Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) committee, where I contributed in structuring and planning the new CCE curriculum.

In all my teaching experiences, my most memorable moments come from my interactions with students. As an educator, I have found great meaning in the etymology of the very word ‘education’. It is commonly said to have been derived from the Latin word ‘ēdūcō’, which means to ‘draw out’. I believe that as educators, we aim to draw out the best from each unique individual student so they can become the best version of themselves.

Having met fellow teachers who have been pioneers of schools, I have heard many interesting stories, and they sparked in me a hope to have such an opportunity. I find it exciting and challenging to see a junior college start from the ground up, and am thoroughly thrilled to be part of this journey with Eunoia Junior College.
