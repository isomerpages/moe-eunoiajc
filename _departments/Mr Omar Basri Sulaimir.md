I graduated with a Master of Arts in Southeast Asian Studies from the National University of Singapore in 2015 and I was awarded the Benjamin Batson Gold Medal for being the best graduate student in the course. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Arts (First Class Honours) from the National Institute of Education in 2012 and I was awarded the Koh Boon Hwee Scholars Award, the MENDAKI Excellence Award, the Rotary International 75th Anniversary Gold Medal Award and the Jurong Shipyard Book Prize for being the top student in the History department.

Before joining the Eunoia family, I taught at a junior college and an integrated programme school. As a Student Council teacher in both schools, I had the opportunity to lead and develop students through various events such as Matriculation and Orientation, Leadership Training Camps and Leaders’ Conversations. I also had the privilege to mentor students in the Scholars’ Programme and it was indeed a fulfilling experience to be able to help students achieve their scholarships of choice.

Such experiences helped to crystallise my vision of education. To me, students should not merely focus on academics alone and instead should realise the importance of a holistic development. It is therefore essential to educate the hearts and the minds of students as that would equip them with the resilience and joy of learning – qualities that are necessary to remain passionate in life. As such, I believe that the role of a teacher should then be to continuously inspire students to stretch themselves to their fullest potential and to be motivated to define and achieve success in their individual areas of excellence.

In my free time, I serve as a floorball referee in the National Schools Games. This allows me to give back to the local floorball scene and be given the opportunity to instil the values of fairplay and sportsmanship among players.
