I graduated from the National Institute of Education with a Bachelor of Science (Education) in 2014.

I taught Physical Education and Mathematics in a secondary school for 5 years before making the switch to Eunoia Junior College. At my previous school, I was in charge of the Volleyball boys’ team, which achieved the National ‘C’ Division Boys runners-up in 2015.

Eunoia’s college motto, ‘Beautiful Thinking, Goodwill to All’ strongly resonates with me and as a Christian, I believe in serving others and putting others before yourself. I hope that through my example, I can empower my students to be kind and empathetic individuals. It is also my sincere hope that through the Physical Education lessons I teach, they will be able to reap the benefits of sport and fitness and pick up values that they can apply to their day-to-day lives.

Outside of work, I enjoy watching and playing both tennis and football. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends. Finally, I have an undying love for the American television sitcom, Friends.

I am grateful for the opportunity to teach in Eunoia and I hope to continue learning from my colleagues and make an impact on the students I cross paths with.
