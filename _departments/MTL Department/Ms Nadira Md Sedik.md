I earned my Bachelor of Arts (Education) degree in 2003 and a Master in Education (Malay Language) in 2013, both conferred by the National Institute of Education.

I started my teaching career in Ghim Moh Primary School before moving on to teach at Tanjong Katong Secondary School and subsequently Gan Eng Seng School. As a Malay language teacher, my most gratifying teaching moment was in 2004 when more than half of my first batch of secondary four students obtained distinctions for their Malay Language subject in the O level examination. In 2007, I was appointed as the Commanding Officer (CO) of Tanjong Katong Secondary School, NCC (Sea) Unit. In my first year as a CO, I managed to steer the unit to win the Best Sea Unit title in the Best Unit Competition – a title which it held onto for 3 years running. I was awarded the Certificate of Achievement for Attainment of the Gold Award in the Best Unit Competition (2008) through Excellence in Leadership and Unit Administration. As a Malay language coordinator, I planned and ensured the smooth running of all programmes and activities under my charge. I was also appointed as a subject mentor to new Malay language teachers and did professional sharing at cluster and national level. In September 2014, I had a teaching stint at the National Institute of Education. This opportunity broadened and deepened my understanding of education at a national level.

As an educator, I hold on strongly to the need for continuous learning and improving. Drawing inspiration from a quote by writer Rabindranath Tagore, “Don’t limit a child to your own learning”.  Students of today are living in a different age and time than us.  We cannot limit our teaching to what we have been taught as it will not do justice to our students. By always seeking knowledge and progressing, we will be able to provide a relevant and vibrant learning experience to our youth. We will be able to equip them with the necessary skills to help them navigate a challenging and uncertain world in the 21st century.

After teaching in primary and secondary schools, I wish to gain teaching experiences at the next educational level. I believe having that broad continuum of students’ will help me to put things into better context and sharpen my teaching strategies as an educator.  Being part of a new JC is an added advantage as apart from the learning opportunities, I am able to experience the establishment of a school. I feel thankful to be given this opportunity.

I love to bake and cook. I find these activities therapeutic simultaneously providing me the platform to express my creativity through cake decoration or the food I am preparing. I also enjoy travelling and reading.
