I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese Studies (First Class Honours) from the National University of Singapore in 2014, under MOE Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Scholarship. I was awarded the Tan Kah Kee Gold Medal Award for being the best student in Chinese Studies in 2014.

Prior to joining Eunoia Junior College, I was doing my teaching stint in a secondary school. I have always been a firm believer in the Chinese saying 教学相长. By learning you will teach, by teaching you will learn. Having taught Chinese Language for a number of years has enabled me to gain valuable insights and experiences. This has motivated me to adopt new teaching pedagogies and reflective practices in my lessons and for my students.

As a Chinese teacher, I believe that the Chinese language is important not only because of its economic values but also because of its cultural values. In fact, the same thing can be said about every language. Translation and communication across two languages or two cultures are thus important as they open boundless opportunities for us to understand another culture which we are unfamiliar with. However, there are always some values that reside in languages which are untranslatable; that is the fundamental reason why I believe that being bi- or multilingual is a core skill that students should cultivate. Knowing an extra language, just like learning Mathematics or Science or philosophy, will help us to look at the world differently and appreciate it from a brand new perspective.

What can be more fun than understanding and appreciating the world and ourselves? Learning is fun and so teaching is fun. I look forward to sharing my joy of learning with all my students in Eunoia Junior College.
