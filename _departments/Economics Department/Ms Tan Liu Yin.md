I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. After which, I joined a multinational ship management company as an accounts executive. This stint in the maritime industry was enriching and I enjoyed the opportunity to work with people from around the world. However, I knew that I have always wanted to share my love for Economics with the younger generation. I want them to see that their lives are surrounded by economics issues and having economic literacy is vital in interpreting events happening around them. Thus, I decided to join teaching to share the knowledge and bring the real world into the classrooms.

My teaching career officially began in 2011. Prior to joining Eunoia Junior College, I taught H1 and H2 Economics at my previous schools. There, I was presented with various opportunities such as JC2 H2 Economics coordinator and team PLC in-charge. Being a member of the ICT committee, I like to incorporate the use of technology in the classroom to make learning more interactive and collaborative. These experiences have equipped me with techniques and pedagogies to meet the needs of students with diverse abilities to ensure quality learning of students.

Interest is a powerful process that contributes to learning and achievement. To raise students’ interest in Economics, I strive to make my lessons fun, interesting and relevant by bringing in real-world scenarios and personal experiences to weave connections between me, the subject and the students. In addition, I strongly believe in building student-teacher rapport and creating safe classroom environments for learning to take place. My greatest joy is watching my students gain confidence in themselves, realise their potential and grow as individuals.
