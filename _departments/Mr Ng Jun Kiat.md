I graduated from Nanyang Technological University with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Economics (Honours). Thereafter, I completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Education with the National Institute of Education.

In my previous IP school, I worked closely with my colleagues to ensure the all-round development of the students where they are of character while excelling in academics and CCA. I supervised and oversaw the Softball Team for three years, achieving notable achievements as ‘B’ Division National Champions in 2018 and 2019.

I decided to be a teacher because I have never forgotten the wonderful times I spent in school, and I love being in a school environment. It is more crucial than ever in today’s VUCA world, the role that educators play in shaping the values and learning of our youth is more crucial than ever. Being a teacher is both a privilege and a responsibility: that I seek to nurture students to be youths with purpose, thinkers with heart and leaders with courage.

I enjoy sports and fitness. Outside teaching, I enjoy playing volleyball, going to the gym and spending time with my loved ones. I hope to share my passion for sports and learning to the students.

The meaning of Eunoia - beautiful thinking, goodwill to all, and a bridging of the heart and the mind - resonates deeply within me. I hope to use this as a guiding principle for me as a teacher to advocate the values of kindness and thoughtfulness to my students.
