Momentous is probably the only word we could use to describe the 9th of January, 2017, the very first school day for Eunoia Junior College. What would we have done on most 'first days'? Assembly in the hall , singing of the National Anthem, taking of the pledge, followed by briefing after briefing on subject combinations, school rules, reporting and dismissal times, and so on, and so forth, and so many a routine to be  endlessly repeated? Not so in Eunoia, apparently.

Our first cohort of Eunoians from the Joint Integrated Programme would gather in their assigned Orientation Groups (OGs) at separate venues, meeting new friends from different schools and their new teachers for the two years ahead. The goal was to become a tightly knit OG and a tight-knit college community, as every student was tasked to forge new bonds with ribbons in the colours of Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School and Singapore Chinese Girls' School.

Games to break the ice, heritage stations that brought our Eunoians up close with the college campus, station games, and college cheers livened the proceedings further, just as the typical anxieties of a first day in school wore off. Friendship goals too were set and quickly broken. Selfies, wefies and all manner of snaps were taken. There would even be free scoops of ice cream and plates of _muah chee_ served with love by Parents@Eunoia to accompany the medley of  #EJFriendshipGoals Instagram posts.

Not before long, our Eunoians would converge - as a college - in the Atria for the launch of the college dance. Our Eunoia teachers too could not stop the feeling to join in the magical moves choreographed by the Orientation student-leaders. Eunoia colours were heard and felt in the air. In those moments, Eunoia became reality, but the dream is only just beginning.
