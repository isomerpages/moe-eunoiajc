On 16 August 2019, the college welcomed Mr Yang Hua, Principal of Chongqing No. 8 Middle School and a contingent of nine primary and secondary school principals from Chongqing province. Principal of Eunoia Junior College (EJC), Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng and several heads of department hosted the contingent for a tour of the school's facilities, lesson observations, and an exchange session with 80 students from the college's Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP).

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mrs Wong recalled that in 2016, the Ministry of Education, Singapore, the Chinese embassy and the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission established a partnership between Chongqing No. 8 Middle School and the college even before we welcomed our first cohort of students.

The overseas exchange programme is one of the key components of the BSP, allowing students to appreciate and understand the socio-economic developments that have taken place in China. The college had the opportunity to visit Chongqing No. 8 Middle School in 2017 and 2018, receiving a warm reception and leaving with fond memories.

In the light of the growing partnership between the two schools, Eunoia Junior College is pleased to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Chongqing No. 8 Middle School, marking the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

2019年8月16日，重庆市第八中学杨华校长带领重庆市九位中小学校长来到新加坡诺雅初级学院，与张美馨院长和各部门主任进行了会谈交流。校长们参观了学校各个设施、进入课堂观课，并与80位诺初双文化学生共进午餐和交流。

张美馨院长在谅解备忘录签署仪式致辞时，回顾诺初2016年，在还未迎接第一批学生时，就通过新加坡教育部和中国大使馆、重庆市教委牵线，与重庆八中建立友好学校关系。海外浸濡游学是诺初双文化课程的重点活动之一，让学生通过浸濡，了解中国现今的发展状况。我们在2017和2018年到访八中，受到热情的接待，收获丰盛，两次都留下美好记忆。

鉴于两校愉快的合作经历，我们签署合作谅解备忘录，标志两校关系进入新的里程碑。
