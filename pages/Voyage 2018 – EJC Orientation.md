With you, Eunoia is complete. Those were the words of Mr Ganison Rajamohan, Dean (JC1) and our Principal, Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng, who welcomed the 2018 JC1 cohort to the family. There would be no finer welcome on Matriculation Day, 2 Feb 2018. To the sound of raucous cheers from the college's five houses, our newly-minted JC1s from 61 different secondary schools were greeted and inducted into the family.

Over the next five days of Orientation, they were introduced to the rigours of junior college life, from making their subject combination choices to the various learning opportunities that await them. Just as importantly, they would become one through various heritage games, cheers and songs, and a series of water games to bring down the temperature and keep spirits as high as can be.

A voyage would not be complete without a bit of adventure. In their pirate crews, the Orientation Groups travelled to different locations including the Jurong Lake District, Jurong East, the Green Corridor leading to King Albert Park and the Alexandra, Clementi and Queenstown neighbourhoods, completing challenges that connected them to the community. These discoveries took them to a deeper, more meaningful experience in the final leg of their journey.

In between building their pirate ships and competing in sporting friendlies, our JC1s did not forget to put together mementos show their appreciation for their Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs). Hand in hand, they would learn the college anthem and sing it in unison for the first time - a sight to behold, and a sound that the OGLs would not forget.

Of course, the finale would be no less memorable, with performances by the now-iconic XYZ, Deputy Principal Mr Poh Chun Leck with Music teacher Mr Xie Zhizhong and the OGLs, not to mention a Eulympics segment to rival a Japanese variety show in fun and weirdness. Shining in the dark were the real stars of the week - our JC1s - who danced, glow sticks in hand, in what will be a Eunoia tradition for many years to come. We will rewrite the stars, they sang, and write Eunoia's bright future, they will.
