The 2023 Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) Appeal Exercise is for students who have not been posted to Eunoia Junior College (EJC) under the JAE Posting Exercise.

**Students admitted to other institutions via Direct School Admission (DSA-JC) are not eligible for this exercise.**

The official appeal period for JAE is from **2 Feb to 8 Feb 2023 (12nn).**

Appeals for transfer to Eunoia Junior College will be based on merit. Students who wish to appeal on other grounds are unlikely to be successful if they have not met the course Cut-Off Point (COP) for the year and do not present extenuating circumstances to merit a transfer.

The 2023 COP is 6 for the Science course and 8 for the Arts course.
