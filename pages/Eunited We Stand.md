Eunoians Eunite! Our Year 4 students from the Joint Integrated Programme were invited to join us on a full day of cheers, activities and a Eunoia GO! trail that brought us around Ghim Moh, Holland Drive, and Buona Vista.

Our pioneers were tasked with locating specific landmarks at Pokestops in the neighbourhood, and with forming the letters E, U, N, O, I and A in creative and cohesive ways. Each group even had to invite a passerby to take a group photo with them! More of their brilliant creations can be found on Instagram with the hashtag #eunite16.
