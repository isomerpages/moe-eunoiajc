Our First Class of Eunoians have shone brilliantly in the college's beginning years. To learn more about their outstanding holistic and academic achievements, we asked our pioneering students to share their thoughts on their experience and words of encouragement with their juniors. Eunoians are defined not just by their academic achievements, but who they are as people and the impact they leave on the world. Read more about our first class in Volumes [**2**](/first-class-2/), [**3**](/first-class-3/), [**4**](/first-class-4/), [**5**](/first-class-5/) and [**6**](/first-class-6/).

**Marisa Lim (17-O5)** is a German Language Elective Scholar, placing on the Dean's List (Academic) in 2017 and 2018 and the Dean's List (Character & Service) in 2017 for her meticulous leadership as Class Chairperson. She was also presented the MOE Edusave Character Award. An aspiring sportswoman and leader, Marisa balanced competing in the 'A' Division Badminton, travelling to MOE Language Centre for German lessons and a long-term commitment to Youth Corps Singapore programmes such as the Elderly Fitness Programme and A Walk to Remember. Furthermore, Marisa volunteered as an educator and facilitator for the World Wildlife Fund and Goethe-Institut Singapore. In between, she led her peers and juniors as a Clan Head during the 2018 Orientation programme.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I feel pleasantly surprised about my results and definitely very shocked too. I immediately started crying as I was so happy that all the effort I have put in paid off. What helped me achieve these results was the resilience of my teachers, friends, family, who pushed me along. It was also the hard work I put in over the past two years. It was not an easy journey, but it is definitely worth the while.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My two years here were not as smooth-sailing as I first expected. It was filled with many ups and downs, but these tests of resilience have moulded me into the person I am today.

What made this journey meaningful for me were the friendships forged here, the care and concern from the teachers, as well as college activities that made JC life here so colourful. My family, friends, and teachers made this journey worthwhile as I want to do them proud and reciprocate the support I have received from them.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Take care of yourself, physically, emotionally and mentally. Stay healthy, eat regularly, and get adequate rest over the two years, because having a healthy mind, heart, and body will facilitate better learning.

Form support groups. Journeying alone over the two years is not only tough but meaningless. The friendships I have forged here not only supported me on my darkest days, but also made this journey worth the while.

Start early. I cannot emphasise this enough! Every day leading up to the A-Levels is a chance to add to your preparation. Give your undivided attention at lectures and tutorials. All the best!

**Jiang Haowen (17-O3)**, a MOE Pre-University Scholar, embodies academic excellence and curiosity, pursuing H3 Semiconductor Physics and Devices at Nanyang Technological University, representing the college at the Singapore Chemistry Olympiad (Merit), consistently placing on the Dean's List (Academic) and attaining Commendation Awards in Economics, Physics and Chemistry in 2017 and 2018. As Class Chairperson and a house committee member for Ora house, he showed leadership in bringing his class together, planning college activities and organising house events. Also placing on the Dean's List (Character & Service), Haowen volunteered at Meet-the-People sessions in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC on a weekly basis and contributed in National Youth Council activities such as the Amazing Heartland Race.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

Upon receiving my results, I was thrilled. Even though I spent countless hours studying and felt really prepared, there was a sense of anxiety that everyone would inevitably feel on results day. I am incredibly glad that all my hard work paid off.

Definitely the many hours spent in the library studying and revising were what helped me achieve these results. Together with some of my classmates, we would stay back daily to study all the way until the school’s closing hours. Our mutual encouragement and support allowed me to persevere.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My two years in Eunoia were not easy, but they definitely gave me an incredibly meaningful and fruitful journey. These two years have been a time where I discovered what I wanted to do, and who I wanted to do it with. This helped to forge and strengthen many friendships along the way.

My class spent almost all our time in school together, from studying after school to playing sports over the weekends. We still meet regularly after the A-Levels and my class has made this journey meaningful.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

In your academic journey, consistency is key. Start early, and always aim to finish your work on time. Starting is the most important part - even if it means doing only question. By studying consistently, you can avoid the last-minute exam rush that many people fall into. This will help you manage exam stress better. That being said, always allocate time for your class, CCA, and friends. Although results are undeniably important, your memories of the people you achieved those results with will be even more valuable.

**Nicholas Lee Jun Yi (17-E4)** is known to peers and teachers as the college's resident filmmaker and one of the founding members of Advocado Films. He was a committed Head of Training (Video) for EJC Media, leading several teams to conceptualise and produce videos for Orientation, Commendation Day and College Day. Setting a high bar from the first year of the club, his team achieved a Gold Award at the Schools Digital Media Awards in the video category in 2017. Moreover, Nicholas applied his dedication and meticulous project management skills to serve in a range of community service projects, including a newspaper collection drive. In the classroom, he was a resolute learner always committed to excellence, possessing a natural aptitude in the sciences and interest in new perspectives with a maturity well beyond his years.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I am honestly glad to have done well for my A-Levels. Overall, I am relieved that my long hours of studying and practicing have eventually paid off. For me, the key was to do consistent revision over the weekends, and I did so by doing repeated practice during my free time. This helped me to sharpen my answering techniques substantially over a short period of time. Content-wise, writing detailed notes in different colours was my prefered method of studying. Representing information in an organised manner that I understood clearly has been particularly helpful in content heavy subjects like Physics and Chemistry. Also, sleeping early is extremely important! Always ensure that you get enough rest before the papers.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

It has been enriching and meaningful, just as much as it was academically demanding. Just like any other JC2 student, I faced a lot of stress coming from various avenues.

The first group of people that came to my mind was my friends. I had the chance to make many new friends along the way, and they were integral in helping me to stay motivated. We pushed each other towards our individual goals by sharing notes, clarifying questions, and teaching each other. When I had long breaks, being around a bunch of hard working schoolmates motivated me to study during my free time, and helped me to avoid procrastination.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Always do your best, and never give up. As Mrs Kellie Woo said, your grades do not define you. Always strive for better performance. Most of the time, it is our mindsets that hold us back, so in order to be better, you need to believe that you can be better, and sometimes all it takes is to ‘fake it till you make it’. Never lose sight of your end goal and constantly push yourself regardless of your current performance. Encourage yourself to work even harder nearing the A-Levels, but take occasional breaks such that you do not burn out prematurely.

**Faith Angeline Yeh (17-I1)** and **Grace Marie Yeh (17-I3)** are sisters. Both alumnae from Singapore Chinese Girls' School, they matriculated as Eunoians through two different pathways. Faith joined the college via the Joint Admissions Exercise as an O-Level Programme student and Grace was admitted via the Joint Integrated Programme. Faith was a student in the Arts stream, and Grace was a Science stream student.

Faith was an industrious and preternaturally curious student who stretched herself in diverse fields. She demonstrated her flair for English in the World Youth Essay Competition, joined the Eunoia Global Orientation programme trip to Chongqing and Chengdu in China, participated in the National Healthcare Medical Symposium and won an internal poetry competition with her entry based on the theme of 'Unity'. She continued to pursue her passion in music, performing alongside Grace in a recital at library@esplanade in 2017 and clinching a silver award in the Performers' Music Festival in 2018. Faith was also instrumental in the formation of the EJC Student Ambassadors corps and is part of a group seeking to establish the college's alumni association.

Grace was an exemplary student in the college's Music Elective Programme (MEP), performing at a national MEP outreach event held at the National Gallery Singapore and at a dance showcase for tertiary institutions at the Singapore Dance Theatre. She is also a talented dancer who choreographed and performed at numerous school events including the inaugural College Day in 2017. Alongside her academic achievements and placing on the Dean's List (Academic), she served as the Head of Press in EJC Media, and is a founding member of Eunoia Origin, an online student voice publication.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY TO THE A-LEVELS HERE IN EUNOIA?

**Faith**: My journey in EJ can be described as a marathon. I think it's a marathon not for a single person but many people together. I am really grateful to have my friends, my classmates, fellow Eunoians from the Arts stream, and everyone just being there for me and walking through the journey together. There were subjects like History that were very content heavy and very abstract concepts that we couldn't immediately grasp in Literature but together we pulled our resources together and we helped each other to achieve what we could not have achieved by ourselves.

**Grace**: I would say it is like a rollercoaster - full of ups and downs. I learned how to thrive when there is a lot of pressure, there are a lot of responsibilities, there are many things due in one day which you to get done. I am very thankful for all the skills that I can take with me to university and beyond. What is important is the process, and not the end result.

##### WHAT WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU FACED, AND HOW DID YOU OVERCOME THEM?

**Faith:**  A constant challenge for me was Mathematics. I was practising many, many questions but still doing poorly. I realised that it was not so much a lack of practice but rather, that you need to be very deliberate in my practice - undoing mistakes, redoing papers, building upon my foundation, knowing what you know and what you do not know and moving on from there. You may be tired and wary from tests and examinations, but it is important to know your own performance and learn to do better the next time. Do not be afraid to seek help from peers and teachers because you are never alone in what you do.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

**Grace:**  Never forget who you are as a person. Don't forget to show yourself love. I didn't believe this at first, but it's very important. Do not compare yourself to others. Sleep early, eat well and pick yourself up whenever you fall.  Take it one day a time.
