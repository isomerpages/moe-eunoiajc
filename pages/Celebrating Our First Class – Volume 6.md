**Nicholas Koh (17-E2)** was an inspiration to his peers as President of the first Student Council and a mainstay on the Dean's List (Academic) and Dean's List (Character & Service) for his courage and integrity. Pioneering many initiatives and projects, Nicholas always sought to celebrate and spread the word on the best of the school while working with fellow Eunoians to build the college culture. Beyond Student Council, Nicholas took up a new sport as a player on the Squash (Boys) team and found time to create a special interest group for Ultimate Frisbee that would become a CCA today. Given his vast contributions and fortitude as a leader, Nicholas is a true trailblazer in and for the college.

##### WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR JUNIORS TO HELP THEM ALONG THIS DIFFICULT JOURNEY?

I would say: be strong, always be ready to pick yourself up and carry on, because JC to some may be a struggle, a completely different page, a whole new story, from Secondary School. But whatever happens, just know that there’ll always be a better day even if there are downsides. You’ll always be good enough to get what you want to achieve, so just work hard, and when you’re with your friends, enjoy yourself, have fun, and smile as much as you can. Because once you’re out of JC, you’d realise that JC life is really quite fun and you’ll start to miss it a lot. So, despite the A-Levels and all the hectic studying, really take time to be yourself, find out who you are as much as you can, and enjoy your time as much as you can as well. Go learn, and play a lot, while studying.

Sometimes, some of you might feel disheartened or disappointed: maybe you’re not getting the results you want, or you’re not getting the positions you want, but just know that at the end of the day, there’s always another day to improve yourself; there’s always a better day to come, so, pick yourself up. You can take awhile to be sad, to be anxious, and worry about stuff, but, ultimately, just pick yourself up and continue going on. There’s a long way to go, and there’re many things to come, and I have faith that each and every one of you will grow and become better people, slowly but surely.

**Celine Lee (17-E2)** showed great tenacity as the Deputy President of the first Student Council, taking on leading roles in the school's orientation programmes, the first College Day in 2017 and the official opening ceremony in 2018. Celine was an ever-present leader who was also seen as an emcee at the college's Road Run and one of the lead actors in the Drama Club's first production. Demonstrating an admirable responsibility and perseverance, Celine has made significant contributions to student culture in Eunoia.

##### HAVING BEEN THROUGH THIS INTENSE JOURNEY, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR JUNIORS?

During my time in JC, especially in JC2, I also heard a lot of advice from my seniors from SCGS, and I can understand how the juniors are feeling right now. Many are probably going to think that whatever we say is not true, but after today I realised that there is some truth in what our seniors say. When I was in J2, my seniors told me not to give up, because the last part of your studying, the period between the Prelims and the ‘A’ Levels, is going to be hard, but it’s actually where your learning curve is going to be the steepest; it’s actually where you’ll learn the most.

So, for me, because my first few months of my JC2 year were very hectic, I had a lot to keep up with a lot during the last few months. So my advice is really to not give up, especially during the Mid-Year Exams and Prelims, because they are a very good indication of where you stand, so do your best. If things get hard, you can find a teacher to speak to, or you can just ask for help, because you’re not alone in this race, and many people are alongside you. They’re all taking the same test and they are probably feeling the same way as well. And also, if there’s a certain subject that you’re not so good in, or if you happen to not do so well in a certain paper, don’t let it bring you down. In fact, let it be the driving factor and the thing that motivates you to improve and work on it, to do better.

**Xavier Lee (17-A4)** was a student councillor and the first Akila House Captain, demonstrating leadership in trying to up the morale of his team of councillors and House Executive Committee. He helped to build a sense of identity within his house and the college, organising the student match support for the National School Games 'A' Division Hockey (Girls) Final. One who rises to the occasion, Xavier was also a key member of the EJC Floorball team.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I feel very happy about my results. This is all due to the hard work of my teachers. They never hesitated to give us consultations, stayed back after school to comfort us when we needed it and worked tirelessly to help us improve in both our academics and character.

I am also very grateful for my close bunch of friends who went through thick and thin with me during the exam period, studying with each other until late at night and also encouraging each other to push on.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My two years in Eunoia were unique and extremely fulfilling. As Mr. Poh once said: “Pioneering is no easy work.”, I am very grateful to have been granted the opportunities to lead and help create the school culture here. Despite a shaky start, we were eventually able to kick things off and create fond memories for ourselves.

For me, the journey wasn’t just meaningful because of the fact that we happened to be the inaugural batch. It was meaningful because of how all Eunoians gave these two years our all, and we did our very best to create something out of nothing, leaving behind us an important legacy.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Don’t give up. Through my time in EJ, I have experienced many lows and tough times but at the end of it all, I persevered through it and the results you reap will be priceless. More importantly, work hard and enjoy yourselves. Two years are short and they will be over before you know it, so make the most out of it.

**Nicolette Tan (17-A3)** is an exceptional all-rounder who gave her best in everything. Serving as Captain of Badminton in EJC and Head of the Culture committee in the first Student Council, Nicolette was pivotal in shaping the college culture, from conceptualising school merchandise to writing school cheers. Most notably, Nicolette was involved in initiating Euphoria, an islandwide amazing race and beach finale on Sentosa island. In the college, Nicolette has received various accolades including the MOE EAGLES Award, the MOE Edusave Character Award, the MOE Pre-University Scholarship and has placed on both the Dean's List (Academic) and Dean's List (Character & Service) in 2017 and 2018. In the sporting arena, she achieved multiple peaks of excellence, representing the nation at the 9th ASEAN School Games and the Asian Badminton Schools Championships, taking on the role of oath-taker at the latter.

**Dean Tay (17-A3)** was unwavering, energetic and selfless in leading Akila house as Vice-Captain, IC of the Orientation Group Leaders in 2018, and in taking on badminton as a new sport. Building a collective spirit within the house and the college, he embodied servant leadership and encouraged others to contribute to school identity and belonging. Throughout this time, Dean continued to dedicate time and effort to the National Police Cadet Corps at his alma mater, Catholic High School, giving back to the CCA that developed him and developing his juniors into genuine leaders like himself. For his exemplary character as a role model, Dean was placed on the Dean's List (Character & Service) in 2017 and 2018 and awarded both the MOE Eagles Award and MOE Edusave Character Award in 2017.

**Jolyn Ho (17-A3)** was highly regarded by all her peers as Class Vice-Chairperson in 2017, Class Chairperson in 2018, Vice-President of the Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) and as an Orientation Group Leader for the pioneer cohort's orientation in 2017. In recognition of her leadership, discipline and maturity, she was awarded the MOE EAGLES award in 2017 and placed on the Dean's List (Character & Service) in 2018. In all her roles, she displayed meticulous planning alongside passionate commitment, giving voice to others while growing adaptable and resilient to difficult situations. 

##### HOW HAVE YOUR TWO YEARS HERE AT EUNOIA BEEN? WHAT WAS MOST INTERESTING FOR YOU?

**Nicolette:**  These 2 years in Eunoia have been very fulfilling, and I managed to step out of my comfort zone as well, because JC has been very rigorous academically, so taking on two CCAs— Badminton and Student Council — has been very tough. But it’s fulfilling to see events that we organised for the first time — events such as Euphoria, Orientation, and many others. As the pioneer batch, we were the first in whatever we did, so I’m glad that our batch and our juniors enjoyed it.

**Dean:** My 2 years in Eunoia have been extremely enjoyable, having pioneered the first Orientation for JIP students, then organising the second for the first full cohort, the third and fourth for my junior cohort. Seeing the two cohorts grow together has been a highlight, as well as our progression as a school, continuing to extend our reach to greater heights. As someone who was there since the start, I feel very proud that I’ve been a pioneer in this school.

##### AS A PARTING GIFT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU OFFER YOUR JUNIORS TO HELP THEM ALONG?

**Dean:** One of my National Service superiors said, “Life is like a glow-stick. Sometimes you need to break in order to shine.” So, having gone through many ‘lows’ in my life, in Eunoia, academically or otherwise, I learnt to pick myself up and I think it’s fine to make mistakes, it’s fine to fall, but it’s how you get up from there and move on. Never give up, and keep close to your friends and family, because they’ll be supporting you all the way.

**Jolyn:** One of the teachers at EJ told me this before: when you commit to something, you make time for it. So, even though I had a very busy schedule as I participated in many events at Eunoia, I tried to commit to these events as much as I did with my academics, so that’s why I could balance everything and do my best.

**Nicolette:** Despite the journey not being smooth-sailing, and we would feel like giving up most of the time, as it’s definitely not easy, there will be a light at the end of the tunnel. I also want to add that, along the way, you should find time to enjoy the little things in life as well, such as spending time with your family. Having a meal with your family is also something to take your mind off the busy schedule that you have. Also, appreciate the little things in life — that’s what kept me going.
