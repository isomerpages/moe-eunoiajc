On 10 Feb 2017, our first cohort of students and teachers made it into the Singapore Book of Records with the largest 'social fabric' of stories and photographs, measuring 9.3m by 5.9m. Read more about our record at **[singaporerecords.com/largest-display-of-personal-notes-on-a-fabric](http://singaporerecords.com/largest-display-of-personal-notes-on-a-fabric/)**.

In two days, our students assembled in their Orientation Groups to visit residents, hawkers and shopkeepers at the nearby Ghim Moh and Holland Drive communities. They gathered personal stories about the people they met and 'mapped' the community through photographs. The twenty-five Orientation Groups then crafted their own collage of stories on a piece of fabric. A total of twenty-seven pieces, including two from the teachers, were stitched together by students from the Service Learning CCA, as well as our school leaders.
