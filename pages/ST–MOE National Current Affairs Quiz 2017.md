On 12 May 2017, the college played host to the fourth round of The Straits Times - Ministry of Education (ST-MOE) National Current Affairs Quiz, or 'The Big Quiz'. It would also mark the college's maiden appearance in the annual competition.

It was a valuable opportunity for the Eunoia student audience, as well as students from Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC), NUS High School of Mathematics and Science (NUSHS) and Yishun Junior College (YJC), to hear from ST Associate Opinion Editor Lydia Lim speak about disruption in the political realm, both in the national and international fronts.

In The Big Quiz segment, the college was ably represented by Ryan Wee (17-O1), Tay Jie Qi (17-E4), Weng Pei Yun (17-E2) and Alex Koh (17-I4). The team from Eunoia held the lead up until the penultimate question, but were overcome by some strategic thinking from both NUSHS and ACJC in the final round.

The college wishes to congratulate the team from ACJC on winning this round of The Big Quiz and thank Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) for the opportunity to host the event.
