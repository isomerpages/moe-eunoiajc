Dear Parents,

We are holding JC2 Parent-Teacher Meet (PTM), where your child/ward’s Civics Tutor(s) will update you on his/her progress thus far, and plan the journey to the A-Level Examination with you and your child/ward.

**Date**:          13 April 2018 (Fri)  
**Time**:          A 15-minute slot, 4.00pm - 7.45pm  
**Venue**:        Eunoia Junior College

Consultation with subject tutors will be from 8.00pm to 8.45pm.  
Our student ambassadors will be at the Atria to guide you to the respective venue.

As the session will take the form of a student-led conference, your child/ward is expected to be present during the meeting. Subject booths will be set up at the various venues to attend to general subject-related enquires. In addition, subject tutors will be available from 8.00pm to 8.45pm if you would like to approach them for subject-related matters.

Registration is on a first-come first-served basis. To respect the time of all parents, please arrive punctually for the slot you signed up for and keep the conversation to the 15 minutes allocated.
