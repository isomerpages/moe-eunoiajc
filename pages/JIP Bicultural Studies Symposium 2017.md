一个论坛，两国关系，三位嘉宾，四所学校 —— 探讨新中关系的过去，现在和未来。8月18日，来自诺雅初级学院、圣尼各拉女校、新加坡女子中学和公教中学的学生们同聚诺雅初院第一讲堂，出席四校联办的双文化论坛，与受邀嘉宾讨论新中关系。三位嘉宾分别是贸工部东北亚司副司长王学慧女士、国大东亚研究所余虹博士，以及前国会翻译主任李慧垣先生。他们根据自己的工作经验，分别从经济贸易、政治和外交角度切入课题，进行了精彩的分析论述，让与会者获益不浅。

On 18 Aug 2017,  students from Eunoia Junior College (EJC), Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School and Singapore Chinese Girls' School congregated for the annual Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) Symposium at EJC's Mount Sinai campus. They had the pleasure of hearing from our three distinguished guests, Ms Wong Yoke Hui, Deputy Director from the Ministry of Trade and Industry - North East Asia Division, Dr Yu Hong, Senior Research Fellow at the East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore, and Mr Lee Hui Huan, former Chief Interpreter of Parliament, on Singapore-China relations of past, present and future. It was an enlightening symposium for our students, as our guests shared their rich work experience and analysis of bilateral relations from economic, political and diplomatic standpoints.
