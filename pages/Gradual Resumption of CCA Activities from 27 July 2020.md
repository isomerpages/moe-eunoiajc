MOE has been progressively resuming school activities over the past two months. Lessons have resumed for both levels of students in Eunoia Junior College. CCA experiences are essential to our Eunoians' holistic development, providing them opportunities to explore their passion, strengthen friendships, and build their character and resilience.

From the week of 27 July 2020, the college willÂ resume lower-risk Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) with appropriate SMMs in place. For instance, there will be a maximum of 20 students per activity. The frequency of CCA training will be once a week, with a duration of not more than two hours per session. Certain CCAs will continue to conduct e-CCA sessions.
