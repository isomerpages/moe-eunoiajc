On 24 May 2019, Eunoia Junior College's 3rd Student Leaders' Investiture saw the ceremonial appointment of student leaders from the class directorate, house directorate, CCA directorate and the 3rd Student Council. The college's Leadership Academy, a leadership development platform for all student leaders, was also formally launched at the event.

In the tradition set by the first cohort, student leaders from the graduating Class of 2019 completed a symbolic handover to the incoming JC1 student leaders with gifts that showed the pride and culture that the first two cohorts of Eunoians have built in their civics groups, CCAs and houses. The college would like to express its appreciation to all student leaders and Eunoians from the class of 2018, who have truly made Eunoia's identity and culture something their seniors and juniors are proud to call theirs as well. Having carved a better _tomorrow_, it is now left to the third cohort - who will be pioneers at the college's permanent Bishan campus - to make their own _history_.

As part of the handover ceremony, the President of the 2nd Student Council, Rebekah Seow (18-A1) and the incoming President of the 3rd Student Council, Lum Wan Tong (18-U1) delivered an address to all in attendance.

##### SPEECH BY 2ND STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT

### Rebekah Seow

Good afternoon Mrs Wong, Mr Shah, Mr Tay, Teachers, Guests and Eunoians.

I am Rebekah. Today is the last time I will be speaking as the President of the 2nd Student Council. It is also the last time that we, as a 2nd batch, would be here as leaders of our CCAs, of the Houses, of Council. And more importantly, today is the day the 3rd batch would be taking over.

This year’s theme is ‘Making History’, something I find hard to talk about. History is just like a book that people will flip through years from now. But we will not know how people will see this story. At this moment, we can only write, and see where it takes us.

As the 2nd batch, we have been writing our chapter in this Eunoia story. After one year, we’re ready to flip to a blank page, for you J1s to continue. And yet, at this moment, I realize that this chapter has gone by in a whirlwind, that I have almost forgotten what it really is about. So, on this last day, I want to take this chance to remember our story. And here goes.

Every story has its fair share of good moments and bad moments. If I were to remember our story, I would remember it for the bad times. The mornings I dreaded what the day would hold. The times I felt helpless, like when it rained at Euphoria and there was nothing I could do about it. The times when I gave it my all, and it still was not enough.

If I were to remember our story, I would remember it for the good times. The times when I felt belonged. The times when people laughed. The times things turned out exactly as planned.

But if I were to remember our story, what I would remember most is not the good times or the bad times, but the moments when it was perfect. Good comes from things going well… but perfect is something else. Perfect is a moment I’m sure we have all experienced. Perfect is that moment when you’re doing something, and for an instant, it hits just you how precious that moment is, and you want to stop time there and then forever.

Perfect is when we won a game, and everyone was cheering. But perfect is also when we lost, and everyone was hugging one another.

Perfect is during Euphoria when the rain stopped and we raved together. But perfect is also during Euphoria when it rained and as classes we stayed together.

Perfect is during Orientation when we sang our College Anthem. Perfect is at Open House when we danced Yeah Yeah Yeah. Perfect is whenever our imperfect batch came together. Perfect is when we helped one another.

This is how I would remember our story.

Firstly, to the J2s – I can only imagine what each of you have been through – the mornings you worried about your team, the afternoons you trained alongside them and the nights you wondered if you have done enough. You have had your bad, your good, but ultimately, thank you for creating the perfect with me.

Now, to the more important people today – the J1 student leaders. The next few pages are blank and you can do whatever you want with it. I have seen your totem poles, your house emblems, the spirit you brought into Eunoia… I am already anticipating your chapter.

As you write your chapter, I have three pieces of advice for you. First, be bold – dare to write a chapter no one has seen before. Second, wait before you judge – people will impress you, but if only you give them the time. Third and most importantly, support one another – help each other through the bad, celebrate the good, create the perfect together.

And hopefully, when you look back on this story a year from now, you will see the bad, the good, but what you will remember most is the perfect.

##### SPEECH BY 3RD STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT

### Lum Wan Tong

Good afternoon Mrs Wong, Mr Tay, Mr Shah, parents, teachers, guests and friends.

I am Lum Wan Tong from 19-U1, President of the 3rd Student Council. With the theme of this year’s Investiture being “Making History”, I am honoured to be standing here and speaking on behalf of the J1 cohort.

Just a few months ago, we were seated here for the first time, lost, wondering what to make of this alien environment and its inhabitants. What is EJ’s culture? Can I really help create change? Will I find my own voice in such a large crowd? We may not have all the answers now, but I know one thing for sure: that we, the Class of 2020, are brimming with fierce desires and the hope of an adventure being unfolded.

Our seniors helped us walk the path in Ghim Moh. Building onto the foundations our J3 seniors established, our J2 seniors took up the challenge of growing EJ’s school culture. From Euphoria to Eunite to Orientation to countless other initiatives, we are extremely grateful for all the long hours they put in to conceptualise and execute these events, and we certainly have huge shoes to fill. May everyone now join me in a round of applause to thank our J2 seniors.

Come next year, our footsteps will be on the newly plastered concrete at Bishan. Where will we go? What mark will we leave behind?

To make our mark on History, I would like to share three aspirations I have for our batch.

Firstly, for us to recognise that History can only be cemented when we stand up for ourselves to create our own narratives. Recently, we had a visitor from the wilderness, the friendly Monitor Lizard! Just like how the Monitor Lizard took the first step to explore a newfound place, we must be courageous to go forth and step up. To stay rooted to our values in the face of adversity, so that we can break new grounds and leave our legacy behind. I believe that EJ can be a space in which everyone is able to define their own History, and where we will stand up to the right thing, and not the popular thing.

Secondly, to make History, we must learn from and improve on what has been done in the past, and be patient with ourselves. Our seniors forged a path for for us courageously. Now, we need to find our identity not just as Eunoians, but as the Class of 2020. How do we achieve that? By building on to what has been done, taking risks and thinking bigger. And yet, we must be careful not to rush into ideas. Just like how Rome was not built in a day, we must take time to build on EJ's school identity, to make it the best it can be. Every single thing we do has the capacity to create magic, not just for ourselves, but for Eunoia as a whole.

Thirdly, History, a GOOD and memorable one while we are at, is not written by one person. It is pieced together by our collective efforts. When we think about milestones in the History of mankind, yes, while we might be able to name a few key figures, we must recognise that their efforts needed a collective force to be actualised. To be able to write our own History in EJ is to be able to have created lifelong memories, for future generations to benefit from our hard work. To come back in 10, even 60 years time, walk down the corridors, and recognise proudly that: Yes. I helped built this. We did this TOGETHER.

The year ahead promises to be a challenging one. But the last thing we should do is to fear. As we grow into our roles, we must not forget those who have helped us get to where we are, and stay humble to serving with passion and sincerity. If we do get burnt out, it is okay to take a break and reach out for help. Our journey is like a 42km marathon, in which the only way we will come out of it stronger is if we remember our long-term vision, pace ourselves and support one another through this journey.

Right now, we are perhaps at the 4km mark of our race. To have started and come this far already would not have been possible without the encouragement and support of our parents, teachers, seniors and friends. Thank you for being our cheerleaders and pacers, for believing in us and giving us the push to step out of our comfort zones. We will run this race together, and run it well.

All in all, I cannot express how excited I am for the possibilities that await all of us, both in Ghim Moh and Bishan. As we embark on this adventure, I hope that the Class of 2020 will be aspire to be remembered for our courage to stand up to the right thing, our drive and sincerity to exceed expectations, and our conscious inclusion of every individual to build our Eunoian story. I hope that we will always remember that our History does not make us, for we are the ones making History. Thank you.
