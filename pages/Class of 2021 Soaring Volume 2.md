**Andre Koh (20-I5)** led and was involved in a wide range of projects in EJC and displayed a spirit of excellence in all he did. He was a highly regarded House Captain, pursued H3 Economics and was a part of Beautiful Minds - truly an all-rounded student. Andre related to his peers with empathy and sensitivity and used his talents for the greater good: seeing his friends struggle with certain types of Physics practical questions, he created a guide that he shared with the whole cohort.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

The results release was indeed an emotional rollercoaster ride. Upon receiving my results, while there were mixed feelings initially, I must say that I am immensely grateful for the hard work that I have poured into my preparation that has paid off. I think deep down, everyone was aiming for the golden 90 rank points, myself included. Nonetheless, I am satisfied with my results as they serve as an important testament to the values I have chosen to hold close to my heart in these short yet significant two years in EJC. There are many things I am grateful for: my family, my friends, my tutors and my faith have all played a monumental role in helping me be the person I am today. They were all vital pillars of support for me in this gruelling and difficult journey. The road to the A-levels is not one meant to be travelled by alone, and I am deeply appreciative of the many individuals in my life who supported, encouraged and motivated me in this particular battle.

##### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR 'LOW POINT' YOU FACED IN 2020-2021? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

A challenge that proved to be a monumental task for myself was juggling different commitments during Orientation 2021, Helios. Along with my responsibilities as House Captain, leading planning, and executing the various House activities as part of the Orientation programme, I vividly recall squeezing as much time out of my schedule as I could to study for my H3 Game Theory course, execute both of my Glide Projects - EJ Beautiful Minds and EJ Loves Food - as well as my leadership commitments in my youth fellowship group. The challenge was not solely about time management, but about being able to give my best in each of these roles. I was very fortunate to have relentless support from my peers in different domains of my life, and this made it easier to tide through this period. Whenever I needed something, I could always count on my friends and family who always made an effort to support me. The idea of a community without walls, always making an effort to reach out to one another for sincere support and genuine help was what I experienced and what helped me overcome the obstacles I faced at the start of 2021.

##### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

I cherish the relationships I have formed over the past two years. It may be hard to stay close once we go our separate ways, but I certainly will work on building the friendships forged in EJC. It is my belief that these treasured friendships are what truly make Eunoia, Eunoia. Years down the road, it is unlikely we will mull over our results or recall the tutorials we rushed to complete in time. What I think will stand the test of time are the memories of the shared effort put into planning events, the hours spent studying, tears shed, and conversations shared.

##### WHAT IS YOUR SECRET TO A FULFILLING JC LIFE / BALANCING YOUR COMMITMENTS AND YOUR ACADEMIC PURSUITS? WHAT ADVICE / ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS IN JC2 AND JC1?

Try. You never know your limit until you’ve finally reached it. And so in pursuit of identifying your limits and boundaries, keep trying, again and again. Passionate people, in my experience, give their best in everything they do. That has been a principle that I hold close to my heart and continue to live by. To my juniors, your time in EJC is a blank canvas ready for you to paint your own story; the colours and materials have all been laid out for you. Treasure your time in EJC. The academic demands are high, but you will forge lasting friendships and memories of times shared with your friends.

**Thoo Bin Xin (20-O1)** was part of the MOE Humanities Scholarship Programme and she revelled in the interdisciplinary analysis that helped her harness what she learned in the classroom to serve others. She was also one of the five students who were selected to be part of the Community Engagement Scholarship Programme (CSP) and she truly exemplified the programme’s aim to develop community leaders, and to provide students with platforms to exercise their leadership and influence. She strongly believes that all children should have access to equal opportunities to learn, and is determined to make a difference to the lives of children who do not enjoy the same opportunities as her. This spurred her to find out more about the lives of children from low-income families, and later founded the initiative, Sense for Sense, in collaboration with a local volunteer group, 6th Sense. She was part of a small team that led 120 students in the college to pool together their knowledge, interests and talents to design thematic lesson plans and activity kits for the children living in the rental blocks in Kebun Baru.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

Initially, I felt a pang of disappointment that I did not do as well as I had hoped. But reflecting on where I was during the A-levels definitely allowed me to be content that I did my best with what I had. Beyond that, I too had an enriching experience over these two years; I was able to develop my passions and grow as an individual. I am grateful for all the friends and teachers that have supported me, especially at my lowest. I really could not have done this without them. I am truly pleased that we all made it through these two years and there is truly so much to be hopeful about for what lies before us.

##### WHAT WAS A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE OR ‘LOW POINT’ YOU FACED IN 2020-2021? HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?

In 2021, I began to seriously doubt my self-worth as a JC student. In addition to that, I had my own problems at home that weighed heavily on my shoulders. “I was never a straight A student, and never got onto the Dean’s List; how can I make it to A levels? If I cannot guarantee my grades in A levels what else do I have?” It was a difficult time trying to balance my responsibilities as a student and a daughter, facing what seemed like an ever-narrowing window of opportunity to make something of my JC journey. I spiralled and, at one point, considered dropping out of school. It was only until I reached out to my teachers that I gradually was able to pick myself up. The support system consisting of my teachers and friends grounded me in the last few months of 2021, and helped me see that there was a way to make it through the A-levels. It showed me that having a strong support system is so, so important. Though my time here was short, the growth and perspectives I got to see and experience was truly extraordinary. JC is no easy marathon, but with the right kind of support, we can all make it to the finish line.

##### WHAT WAS THE MOST MEANINGFUL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA?

The most meaningful part of my journey in Eunoia was certainly the opportunities to volunteer that I was presented with. With school being a safe and nurturing space to pursue our passions, I was able to create for myself a unique JC experience. I am truly grateful that I was given such a space to explore and develop my skill sets. Of course, I also cannot forget the times I have spent with my classmates; they made JC life rewarding even amidst the challenges the pandemic posed. The laughter we shared and memories we have made are things I will cherish.

##### AS THE PIONEERING BATCH OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SCHOLARS, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR JUNIORS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO PRACTISE GOODWILL TO ALL?

I think regardless of what programme we are in and title we have, it is important to remember that we are fundamentally humans on our own journeys. Life has its ups and downs, and we all need a little bit of encouragement to carry on. We can never fully understand one another, but we can definitely help to light the way, even if only for a little while. Take some time to listen to the stories of others and see what you can do to support their journey! We really do not need to do grand things to show that we love and care for someone; sometimes even a short note makes all the difference. Jiayou Juniors!
