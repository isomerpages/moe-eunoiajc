Our second cohort of Eunoians received their A-Level Project Work results on 16 Apr 2019 and have charted the way forward for the college and for themselves with their excellent performance. Ms Adrienne de Souza, Head of Department (Project Work & Flagship Programmes) said,

> "The 2018 cohort has performed tremendously. They learned to collaborate, pitch their ideas, negotiate them and express them beautifully, all while discovering and appreciating each other's strengths. They have proven that Project Work is about connecting the mind and heart, and bringing courage towards their purpose. In future, I hope that our Eunoians will use the skills they have learned in Project Work to solve real problems, and help make our communities, our country and our world a better place for all."

To map our Eunoians' growth, we spoke to three groups of students from 18-U1, 18-I5 and 18-I6 to learn more about their experience, the purpose they found and the connections they made along the way.

###### WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT ABOUT AND WHY DID THE GROUP PURSUE THIS?

**Su Thet Htar San:** Our project was about Sleep Deprivation in teenagers, especially those in Junior Colleges. We had a difficult time selecting a project that was both relevant to our context as well as appealing to us, having switched from many different topics that ranged from the issue of Pink Tax to the over-usage of cell phones. In the end, we chose to tackle sleep deprivation as it was an issue that was close to home and close to our hearts, being fresh in our mind after seeing all our bleary-eyed peers and hearing all the sleep-loss horror stories.

###### WHAT MADE THE PROJECT WORK JOURNEY MEANINGFUL FOR YOU?

**Grace Cheu**: Our PW journey was meaningful because our group worked on sleep deprivation in youths, which we closely relate to, and studying this issue allowed us to gain insights that we could apply or identify in our own daily lives relating to sleeping habits and our lifestyles. It also made us to want to improve our own personal sleeping habits as well after finding out so much more about the causes and effects relating to sleep deprivation. The journey was also made a lot more meaningful with the support and our group members had for one another. It was really heartening to see us caring for one another and stepping up to fill up gaps in instances where some of us might have been struggling with more commitments that particular week.

**Isabel Tan:** At the initial stages of PW, we struggled to find a topic that everyone cared about, and ended up changing our problem three times before finally being satisfied with sleep deprivation. What made out PW journey extremely meaningful and unique to me was how lucky I was to have teammates who were caring, creative and hardworking- brainstorming for fresh solutions and doing endless research for every new problem we found were chores made enjoyable because of these friends. Furthermore, as we shared our solution with peers and teachers alike, we were extremely heartened by the enthusiastic responses elicited, and grew in passion towards refining it and presenting our project in the best way possible.

**Sarah-Ann Tan:** My PW journey was really enriching because of the arsenal of skills I have acquired and honed which have enabled me to grow holistically. Through working on the various group components with my team, for example, I have learnt that a team thrives through capitalizing on one another’s strengths, while having a set of common goals, interests and values which welds the group together given our differences. I have also witnessed the power of confidence and positivity in influencing a team’s dynamics — their contagious nature inevitably galvanises the team to follow suit. I think one of the reasons why my team never saw the need to appoint a leader was because we saw how one another’s enthusiasm and conviction spontaneously empowered and inspired the rest of the team. To conclude, while it was the learning experience that made my journey enriching, most importantly, I thoroughly enjoyed my PW journey for it was the people I worked most closely with who made it absolutely fruitful and meaningful! @isabel @grace @htar <33

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR JUNIORS?

**Grace Cheu:** One piece of advice I would give would be to always be open and do not be afraid to share your own ideas and opinions with your group, even if it might seem unconventional, because you never know if it might spark new ideas in your group members too! Leave some space for fun and creativity when coming up with ideas and don’t limit yourselves!

**Su Thet Htar San:** One piece of advice I would give to our juniors would be to ensure that you work on your project consistently, as there is no room to rest on your laurels. Always seek ways to improve on what you already have until you create a project that you can truly say you’re proud of, and that you can all stand by.

###### WHO WOULD THE GROUP LIKE TO THANK?

**Grace Cheu:** Our group would like to thank our PW tutor, Ms de Souza for always challenging us and pushing us beyond our expected limits and enlightening us in considering new insights, and also for constantly being a source of support beyond what is necessary, forking out long hours in consults and even online consults during weekends. We would also like to thank sleep expert Dr Puvanendran who was really kind in agreeing to an interview with us, even wanting to understand more about our project and having a genuine heart for youths, despite his busy schedule as he is a well-known and highly respected doctor.

**Sarah-Ann Tan:** We would also like to thank Mrs Joanne Lee for her patient guidance and feedback for our OP practices. Her encouragement boosted our self-esteem immensely and inspired us to strive for further improvement in our OP performance. And we must not forget the groups who were in the same OP slot as us! With all our hearts, we would like to thank them for their warmth and kindness, as well as the suggestions they provided to help us refine our speeches. We are very thankful and it has been such a pleasure working alongside them as we prepared for OP together!

###### WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT ABOUT AND WHY DID THE GROUP PURSUE THIS?

**Eric Bryan:** Our project is about water wastage in Changi Airport. Before passing the boarding gate, passengers are required to empty their bottles. Most of the time, passengers will simply throw away their excess water, which will eventually accumulate as Singaporeans travel a lot. Our group chose to pursue this project as we also travel a lot and will sometimes feel guilty when we throw away our excess water as it poses severe consequences. Thus, our group has a common goal of reducing water wastage in Changi Airport, which drives us to pursue this project.

###### WHAT MADE THE PROJECT WORK JOURNEY MEANINGFUL FOR YOU?

**Chloe Tang**: For my group, I learnt to appreciate how all my group members made sure to be as present as possible. As leader, while I did my best to push my groupmates to do more than the bare minimum but I know that nothing would have been done if they did not respond nor care about the subject.

**Nicholas Ton**: I feel that what made this project journey meaningful was the opportunity to generate, develop and evaluate ideas and information using the knowledge and skills we have learnt from other different areas.  This PW journey has allowed me to appreciate the importance of having effective team communication and collaboration when striving towards a common goal.

**Eric Bryan**: Looking back, I believe that PW journey has helped us to be creative and to be aware of various issues in Singapore. It has given us a golden opportunity to help solve an issue and guide us in being a responsible citizen to create a better Singapore in the future.

**Tan Jia Wen**: Personally I feel what made my PW journey the most meaningful were my group mates. They were there, constantly covering for me, being supportive and basically being the biggest blessings I could possibly ask for. A collaborative group is able to make the impossible, possible and the stress a lot more bearable so I’m thankful beyond belief that we were able to get through this together.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR JUNIORS?

**Chloe Tang**: Even if you get a good teacher, don’t get complacent! Having a good teacher is not the be all and end all, the entire PW journey requires the efforts of both the teacher and the group. Make sure you are always on task, ready for consults and don’t waste the time that your teacher gives you during consults. Respect the teacher’s effort and time and she/he will do the same. Even when it seems as if the consult is pointless and repetitive, your teacher will have words of advice to impart to you so really make the most of the time you have!

**Nicholas Ton**: “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean." No matter how talented one can be, there is only so much one can do as an individual. Thus, the only way to achieve your final goal is to work as a team. Always remember to have trust and faith in your teammates as they are constantly there to support you and persevere together with you on this PW journey.

###### WHO WOULD THE GROUP LIKE TO THANK?

**Eric Bryan:** On behalf of the group, I would like to thank our PW tutor, Ms Iris Lee, for tirelessly guiding us throughout the journey. She always gave helpful feedbacks and always gave her best efforts to help us improve on our project and motivate us to do our best, despite her busy schedule with other groups. Without her guidance, our project may not have been a good one as we do not have much experience to embark on such an extensive project.

**Chloe Tang**: On behalf of my group I would like to thank our expert, Mr Tan, who gave us multiple suggestions. He also helped to validate the ideas we had about our project and provided rough cost estimations. It was very helpful because our solution involved a lot of components closely linked to engineering which we were unfamiliar with.

**Nicholas Ton**: On behalf of our group, I would like to thank Mr Damian Boh, for taking time off his busy schedule to help us in our primary research. With the knowledge he had regarding the topic, Mr Boh provided us with many valuable insights on the feasibility of our product, Redivivus Aqua. Furthermore, we are really grateful for his suggestions and feedback which really helped us improve our project.

**Tan Jia Wen**: We’re also immensely grateful for our class as well as our audience during the preparation for oral presentation as they spent hours with us, feeding us constructive feedback that helped us to refine our presentation. Never once did they complain about it being a waste of time and we’re just grateful and fortunate to be surrounded by supportive people. This journey would not have been easy without them so our group just wanted to say that we love you guys, thanks for being there :’)

###### WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT ABOUT AND WHY DID THE GROUP PURSUE THIS?

**Aretha Wan**: Our project addresses the issue of pet abandonment in Singapore, specifically dog abandonment by young couples in Singapore. Two members of our group picked up this issue for the first individual presentation and piqued the interest of the rest of the members and ultimately, we chose to pursue this project as we realised the severity of the situation in Singapore. One would expect the citizens living in a developed country like Singapore to practise responsibility when taking up the duty of caring for another life. Yet, despite the increasing number of animal shelters and welfare groups in Singapore, there is still an increasing shortage of space and manpower. This realisation that the situation was worsening beneath the surface was simply appalling.

###### WHAT MADE THE PROJECT WORK JOURNEY MEANINGFUL FOR YOU?

**Laura Zheng**: Project Work was without a doubt, a very fulfilling experience as it gave us a platform to research deeply into an issue that we all deeply cared about and our passion inspired us to work even harder when faced with times of difficulty to ultimately craft a solution that would truly be able to make a difference. The process of preparing for the Oral Presentation has also greatly improved my public speaking skills and it was very heartwarming to see each one of us genuinely encouraging and giving constructive feedback to each other so that we could all improve together as a group.

**Aretha Wan**: I feel that what made this journey meaningful was the process of finding out more concrete issues underlying the problem and spending time working as a group to come to gratifying conclusions. I learned to appreciate the importance of teamwork and task management, as well as the little miracles that happen. The process of collecting evidence and data was a bit tough but satisfying nonetheless.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR JUNIORS?

**Nicholas Goh**: Throughout your PW journey, as important as it is for members to have differing opinions, it is just as important for you and your group members to cooperate effectively. While conflict at times cannot be avoided, do try your best to view the other perspectives instead of instantly rejecting them and take your time to resolve these issues before moving on. Another important thing to note is to have a base plan of the data that you are planning to collect, as collecting the data you need in one go will allow your group to focus on the written components. Otherwise, it may hinder your group later on as more time is needed to collect the data.

**Tony Li**: Be flexible, open-minded and appreciate the open-ended nature of PW. Enjoy the journey and treasure the learning experiences instead of looking at it as a chore, as the lifelong skills gathered during PW will definitely come in handy and will stay with you long after graduation.

###### WHO WOULD THE GROUP LIKE TO THANK?

**Laura Zheng**: We would like to thank our PW Teacher Mr Kwan for always making time for our consultations both online and offline, his never-ending support and constant guidance throughout our Project Work journey, as well as the interviewees—from NTU robotics professors who gave us valuable insights on how to improve our proposed solutions, to pet shop staff and members of the public for their enthusiastic responses to our survey that were tremendously helpful as it gave us a deeper understanding of the issue and allowed us to stand in the shoes of our target group to create a successful project.

**Jessica Ji:** We would like to thank our PW tutor Mr Daniel Kwan for working alongside with us throughout the journey as well as inspiring us to discover possibilities and do things with purpose, heart and courage. We would also like to thank the interviewees from various organisations and members of the public for their willingness to play a part in our project by providing useful insights and sincere feedback.
