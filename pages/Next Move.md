## What's Your Next Move?

We are moving and going all the way up. And we’d love to have you along. Fond friends, terrific teachers, memorable lessons, house parties and amazing experiences at every corner. We’ve got the right moves to welcome you into the family. Join Eunoia. Move in with us. We go higher.

Make your next move on 16 Jan 2019, 9am - 4pm. Performances, taster lessons, games, CCAs, global orientation and special programmes, food, great swag and our friendly student ambassadors will be ready specially for you. See you at our Mount Sinai campus!
