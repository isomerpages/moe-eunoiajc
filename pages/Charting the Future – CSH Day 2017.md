Our JC1 students had an early opportunity to chart their future at the college's first Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education Day on 4 July 2017.

The day began with a higher education and scholarships fair, at which Eunoians could explore their interests and options. They also had the choice to attend talks by our local universities, the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Management University, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore University of Social Sciences and Yale-NUS College.

For a taste of life beyond our shores, a wide spread of overseas higher education and scholarship sharing sessions by representatives from A\*STAR, MINDEF, the National Council of Social Service, the British Council and the US Education Information Center amongst others.

Thinking further ahead, our students also heard from professionals in different careers during the third wave of sharing sessions. They had the privilege of hearing from Mr Michael Chin, now Head of Asset Management, Singapore and South East Asia at UBS, who shared his experience in several senior roles in corporate finance, fixed income and equities. Ms Cherylene Aw and Ms Quek Pearl Ning from Trans Family Services were also particularly engaging as they opened eyes to the diverse, rewarding work in the social service sector.

The Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education Day informs every Eunoian's Life Coaching Journey, providing opportunities for them to better understand themselves and the future they can carve for themselves. Ending the day with an introspection activity, our students gave further thought to the university courses and career development pathways that suit their purpose in life, the attributes needed and the steps both big and small they can take.
