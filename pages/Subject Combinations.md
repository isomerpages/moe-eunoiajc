All students may propose their **preferred subject combination** if it is not featured in the list of subject combinations, subject to approval.

##### **'HYBRID' COMBINATIONS**

Students intending to offer 2 Mathematics and Sciences subjects and 2 Humanities and the Arts subjects may refer to page 7 of the [**information booklet.**](/files/EJC-SCOPE-2023.pdf) The college offers 12 ‘hybrid’ subject combinations in the **Science** stream: S4-1 to S4-6, and S5-1 to S5-6.

### Considerations

##### **MERIT-BASED ALLOCATION**

Students intending to offer **[H2 Art](/academic-subjects/Humanties-and-the-Arts/art/)**, **[H2 Further Mathematics](/academic-subjects/Mathematics-and-Sciences/futher-mathematics/)**, **[H2 Knowledge & Inquiry](/academic-subjects/Knowledge-Skills/knowledge-and-inquiry/)**, **[H2 Music](/academic-subjects/Humanties-and-the-Arts/music/)** or **[H2 Translation (Chinese)](/academic-subjects/Humanties-and-the-Arts/translation-chinese/)** must pass a selection test/audition administered by the college.

Students intending to offer [**French, German, Japanese or Spanish**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/academic-subjects/foreign-languages/) at H2 or H1 Level must have studied the respective language at MOELC in Secondary 4 or Year 4 prior to joining the college.

If a subject is oversubscribed, students will be selected based on academic merit, including (i) L1R5 aggregate score or equivalent, excluding bonus points, and (ii) performance in the relevant subject(s).

The indicative cut-off point for [**H2 Biology**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/academic-subjects/biology/), [**H2 Chemistry**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/academic-subjects/chemistry/) and [**H2 Physics**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/academic-subjects/physics/) is B3 for the respective subject at the GCE O-Level Examination or equivalent, or A1 for Combined Science at the GCE O-Level Examination.

The indicative cut-off point for [**H2 Further Mathematics**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/academic-subjects/further-mathematics/) is A1 for Additional Mathematics at the GCE O-Level Examination or equivalent.

##### **H3 SUBJECTS**

Designed for outstanding students, H3 subjects are offered in **JC2** together with the stipulated subject at H2 level. Students will be informed of the application process and eligibility criteria in JC1.

##### **SPECIAL PROGRAMMES**

**[Humanities Scholarship Programme](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/special/hsp/)** (HSP) students must offer [**subject combinations prescribed by the Ministry of Education**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/awards-scholarships/programme-scholarships-pre-u), which will include **[H2 Literature in English](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/academic-subjects/literature-in-english/)**.

##### **OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

In the event that there is insufficient student subscription in a particular subject or subject combination, the college reserves the right not to offer that subject or subject combination.

If a subject is oversubscribed, students will be selected based on academic merit.

##### **UNIVERSITY COURSE PRE-REQUISITES**

Your future career may require you to undertake certain degrees and/or courses at the undergraduate level. In turn, these undergraduate courses in the universities may or may not have course-specific subject pre-requisites. As such, you are advised to check the minimum requirements on the university websites directly before making a decision on the subject combination to offer.
