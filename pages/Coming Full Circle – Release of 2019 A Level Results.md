Dear Class of 2019,

**The release of the 2019 GCE A-Level examination results will take place on 21 February 2020 (Friday) at 2.30pm**.

In view of the escalation to DORSCON Orange, the Ministry of Education and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) are stepping up precautionary measures to minimise the potential risks from large gatherings to safeguard your health and well-being.

Please read the following information which will detail how you will be receiving your results.

### **Reporting details for collection of examination results**

If you are well, you may collect your result slips and certificates in the school from 2.30 pm on 21 February 2020. In line with the stepped-up measures that have been implemented in all schools, please declare your travel history using the attached **[Travel History Declaration Form](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Travel-History-Declaration-21Feb.pdf)** which will be collected at the entrance to the college.

Your temperature will also be taken before you are allowed into the campus.  **Do note that you can enter the school only through the Main (West) Gate situated at 2 Sin Ming Place**. Alternatively, you can also access your results online if you prefer not to come to school.

If you are unwell, on a Leave of Absence (LOA) or Quarantine Order (QO) as of 21 February 2020, have recently travelled to Mainland China, or affected by travel restrictions into Singapore, please do not come to the school. You can access your results online.

**Please note that parents, family members and friends will not be allowed into the school premises in view of the current situation.**  **Only candidates collecting their results will be allowed entry into the school premises.**

For Singapore Citizens/Singapore Permanent Residents, you can use your SingPass pin. If you are eligible for SingPass\[1\] but have not activated it, you will receive a SingPass PIN mailer by 19 February 2020. If you are not eligible for SingPass (e.g., International students), SEAB will send an email with one-time login details to you by 19 February 2020.

### **Digital Certificate for Application to Local Autonomous Universities**

Starting from this year, all A-Level candidates, who are Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents, will receive digital certificates in OpenCerts format.

These certificates will be available on MySkillsFuture’s Skills Passport at [**https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/content/portal/en/individual/skills-passport.html**](https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/content/portal/en/individual/skills-passport.html) from 24 February 2020. If you have SingPass, you can access and submit your digital certificates electronically to the Universities that you are applying to.

For international students, you may send your request for a digital certificate via email to **[seab\_gce\_admin@seab.gov.sg](mailto:seab_gce_admin@seab.gov.sg).**

Applications for admissions and/or scholarships to the local Autonomous Universities (AUs) can be done online. All school candidates who apply to the local AUs online do not need to submit a copy of their A-Level certificates. Due to the Covid-2019 situation, the local AUs will also make alternative arrangements for any assessment for admissions if applicants cannot be physically present.

### **Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**

Students who need guidance on their education options can approach their teachers or the ECG Counsellors supporting their schools. Students can also refer to the interactive **[MySkillsFuture](https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/content/student/en/secondary.html)** portal at **[https://go.gov.sg/mysfpreu](https://go.gov.sg/mysfpreu)** to find out more about the education options, career pathways and courses that are suited to their strengths, interests and abilities.

Alternatively, students can contact the MOE ECG Centre @ Grange Road from 14 to 28 February 2020 for ECG counselling via email: [**MOE\_ECG@moe.gov****.sg**](mailto:MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg) or phone: 6831 1420.
