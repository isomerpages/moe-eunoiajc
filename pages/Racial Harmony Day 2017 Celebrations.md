Capping an eventful MTL Fortnight II, the college commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 21 July 2017. The Eunoia community was a sea of colour on an early Friday morning, donning a rich array of ethnic costumes to mark the nation's cultural diversity and cosmopolitan character. In "The Singapore Way", no celebration would be complete without food. Each civics group rose to the challenge of creating a 'Cultural Breakfast' with a spread of Chinese, Peranakan, Malay, Indian, Eurasian and uniquely local dishes.
