On 8 Jan 2018, the second cohort of Joint Integrated Programme students were called to the high seas, and brought together for a five-day voyage to new, deep friendships.

Assembled into five 'pirate crews', they made merry with icebreakers and heritage activities, drowned sorrows and washed away anxieties in water games and charted their course as Eunoians on a longer journey. In true Eunoia fashion, they also spread their goodwill on an amazing race in the Mount Sinai campus neighbourhood, sailing far and wide to Scandinavian fjords on Alexandra Road and windmills atop Holland Village.

Our destinations matter, and so do the people around us. After giving their juniors a rousing welcome on the first day, our JC2s stepped up on stage to add warmth and style to the orientation finale. Our teachers joined in the act as well, performing several songs that won the crowd over. No conclusion was however more fitting than the final performances by the crews themselves. Bonds strengthened and boundaries broken, our newest crew of Eunoians would be ready to set sail for the next three weeks, and welcome even more friends from other secondary schools to join them on a longer, meaningful voyage ahead.
