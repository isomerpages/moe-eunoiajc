Two weeks into the new term, our first ‘cohort’ of teachers took the chance to learn more about the Ghim Moh community. How else, but by doing what Singaporeans do best – eating and shopping! The chance to meet hawkers and shop owners at Ghim Moh Market was something everyone relished, and cherished.

Led by Ms Liu Lijun, Head of Department for Character & Citizenship Education (CCE), we learned more about the methodology of Community Mapping, planning the questions we would ask and the types of observations we would make. Here are just some of the stories, hopes and aspirations of the people we met:

### Kenny

“Meet Uncle Lee’s son-in-law, Kenny! He’s only 32 this yr and he has already earned working experience in hotel and restaurants. His dream is to bring good honest restaurant standard food to heartlanders by using fresh ingredients! Uncle Lee actually showed support for Kenny’s dream by buying the stall beside him to let him run his own business. In fact, before he become his own boss this year, he did his “internship” at Uncle Lee’s stall. Kenny’s speciality is in creating fusion between Italian and Japanese cuisine. By the way, his miso carbonara was a beautiful accident. He accidentally spilled miso soup into his carbonara when he was having lunch! He’s well protected by his helper Dickson who will help manage the food order and queue system so Kenny can focus on creating good food for all. Go say hello to Kenny and Dickson if u have the chance to!”

“Coolest.😎 I just found out from Kenny (Son-in-law of Uncle Lee chwee kueh) that the one helping in the store is his cousin and Uncle Lee is the second Uncle. And…. The Da Zhong coffee stall is operated by the third Uncle! Wow 😮”  
**Mr Jonathan Lee**

### Ginny

“Meet Ginny the biscuit lady. She’s been here 8 to 9 yrs. Haven’t asked her much but she wasn’t aware of our College until I introduced her to us. :)”  
**Ms Lim Li Yan**

“Coming from a very poor background, the lady boss shared with us her growing up years. She didn’t have the chance to eat biscuits as tea at all. Her only memory of “snack time” is when her mum needed to make offerings and she got some orange-top sweets. We are indeed a privileged generation compared to hers! #oldschoolbiscuits.”  
**Ms Iris Lee**

### The Zhang Family

“Fook Choon Won Kee Medical Store – started in 1973 at Bukit Timah. Moved to Ghim Moh 3yrs later and rented for 10yrs. Then bought the place for 99yrs till now. (40yrs in Ghim Moh) Family stays at the HDB upstairs and the Son (in the background) is helping with the business. They learnt today that Eunoia is moving here and are excited to meet the students.”  
**Mr Jonathan Lee**

### Ah Seng and Cedrika

“Ah Seng and his son, Cedrik who manages the durian stall together. It’s heartening to see the next generation’s willingness to help out and take over the hawker business in future.”  
**Mr Jeffrey Ha**
