The college bade farewell to the Class of 2019 in its second and last Graduation Day on the Mount Sinai campus on 18 Oct 2019. Spirits were high from the start of the ceremony, where Karis Goh (18-A3) and was joined on stage by Deputy Principal Mr Adrian Tay for a live rendition of 'Last Long', a song they performed and wrote respectively. Videos prepared by the JC2 Physics team, EJC Media Club, the JC2 civics tutors and Dean (JC2), Mr Ganison Rajamohan were met with a mix of laughter and sadness. The emotion only grew during the college pinning ceremony, urged on by Mr Crispin Rodrigues' reading of 'Take Flight', a poem he penned especially for the Class of 2019.

The five house captains would have the cohort cheering again, a level of energy matched by the performances by the Science department, Mr Alvin Toh and our resident rock band. After the civics groups gathered for lunch and photo-taking, the Class of 2019 came together one last time to sing the college anthem.

For the Class of 2019, may your memories of our Mount Sinai campus and of each other stay with you as your dreams take flight!
