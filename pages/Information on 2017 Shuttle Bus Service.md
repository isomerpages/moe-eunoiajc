1\. One-way shuttle bus services are arranged for students on weekday mornings during the school term. In view of peak hour traffic and other unforeseen delays, **the college has planned for students to arrive on campus by 7.30am**, before morning assembly begins at 8.00am.

2\. The shuttle bus service will commence on **Monday, 9 January 2017** for JIP students. The shuttle bus will leave punctually at the stipulated departure time. **Students are advised to be at the pick-up location at least 5 minutes earlier.**

3\. The table below shows the respective pick-up locations, departure times, capacity and vacancies. The location of the pick-up points can be found below. Pick-up times and locations are subject to confirmation by end of 2016. Number of vacancies is accurate as of 3 Sep 2016. Students will be informed via their college email account.

4\. The shuttle bus service registration exercise was conducted in April 2016 and registration is now closed. However, we still have some vacancies. **Students who did not register for the service earlier, but now wish to, may do so by 22 September 2016.** Hardcopy registration forms are also available at the General Inquiries booth today. Alternatively, students may **email to [eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg](mailto:eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg)** to request for a registration form. Please note that the vacancies will be allocated based on balloting, should the number of new registrants exceed the available vacancies. The remaining vacancies (if any) after 15 September 2016 will be made available to all Eunoians in February 2017.

5\. The co-payment for students is **$250 per annum for 2017, payable at $125 per semester.** The 1st payment is due on 20 October 2016 during the Eunite! programme. **Cheques are to be made payable to “Eunoia Junior College”, with the student’s secondary school, full name and contact number written on the back of the cheque.** No receipt will be issued for cheque payments. Students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme will be fully subsidised.

6\. To withdraw from the service, the student is required to inform the College via email at eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg. There will be no refund if a student does not use the service on certain days (e.g. on MC) or if the student decides to withdraw from the service. 7. With a new intake of JIP students every year, the pick-up locations will be reviewed based on the aggregated needs of the students for that particular year. Hence, students will have to register on a yearly basis based on the pick-up locations.

7. **JAE students** may register for the service **from 24 Feb 2017 onwards**.
