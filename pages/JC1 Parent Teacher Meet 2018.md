Dear Parents,

The JC1 Parent-Teacher Meet (PTM) will be held on 3 Aug 2018 (Friday). You are invited to the session which will provide a platform for you to be updated on the challenges your child/ward is facing. The Civics Tutor(s) will engage you on his/her progress thus far, and plan the journey to the Promotional Examination with you and your child/ward.

The details of the event are as follows:

**Date**:          3 August 2018 (Fri)  
**Time**:          A 15-minute slot, 4.00pm - 7.45pm  
**Venue**:        Eunoia Junior College

Consultation with subject tutors will be from 8.00pm to 8.45pm.  
Our student ambassadors will be at the Atria to guide you to the respective venue.

As the session will take the form of a student-led conference, your child/ward is expected to be present during the meeting. Subject booths will be set up at the various venues to attend to general subject-related enquires. In addition, subject tutors will be available from 8.00pm to 8.45pm if you would like to approach them for subject-related matters.
