Eunoia Junior College marked its inaugural College Day by commemorating the contributions and achievements of its students and partners in shaping the college's identity and culture. The Guest of Honour, in a break of tradition from speech and prize-giving days, was simply 'You'.

The theme for Eunoia's 1st College Day was 'Beginning with a Dream', the first line of our college anthem composed by students from the three Joint Integrated Programme in 2016. And begin with a dream we did. Led by the combined talent of the Choir and Symphonic Band, the college community came together to sing and sign the college anthem using Singapore Sign Language.

Inclusivity and togetherness would define the proceedings for the rest of the day. Mr Wong Liang Tong, Chairman of Parents@Eunoia, presented the college a scroll to signify the enduring partnership between the college and parents. Alumni members of our JIP partner secondary schools, parent-representatives, the Eunoia staff and the College Advisory Committee led by Professor Su Guaning of Nanyang Technological University would also plant three trees as symbols of their shared commitment to grow the college and the students under its care.

The Eunoia dream cannot do without the Eunoian. Soon after the trees were planted, the college's newly elected student councillors presided over the first Student Council Investiture, which they planned and implemented on their own. 1st Student Council President Nicholas Koh then led the councillors and all student-leaders from the pioneer cohort in taking the Student Leaders' Pledge, committing to serve the college with integrity and passion. Passion was not lacking in the ceremony, as the councillors re-took the stage by performing the college dance.

This was aptly followed by three opening performances in the Eunoia Got Talent series, fusing downtempo R&B, a classical piano composition and a modern dance performance into a show of colour and soul. To end an already eventful 1st College Day, our House captains gathered their members for a house party.

Eunoia's 1st College Day was a celebration of Eunoians, to cherish the beginning of shared dreams and to chart the history to be made in the years ahead.
