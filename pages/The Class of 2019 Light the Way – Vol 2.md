**Gisele Yeo (18-I1)** used her outstanding dance talents to make invaluable contributions to the dynamism and vibrancy of college life. She joined the EJC Orientation Organising Committee as Head of Cheers and Dance, playing a key role in developing new college mass dances for the cohort as well as the five houses. Stronger pride in the houses was developed through these dances, and they continue to be an important feature of inducting new Eunoians into college life. Gisele was also a highly-regarded and well-loved Dance Captain, a regular performer at college events and took charge of Cheers and Dance for her House.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I am happy with my results overall, especially as I scored better than I had expected in some subjects. I believe in consistency and hard work and tried my best at each of the assessments over the last two years. I made sure to revise and prepare well, even for seemingly minor timed assignments. This meant I did not have to spend as much time going through the same topic again at the major year-end exams. I also consistently did my homework and I felt I was falling behind, I arranged consultations with my teachers as soon as possible to clarify any doubts.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

At the start of JC1, I found it very hard to cope with the stress. However, my time in EJC just got better and better as the days passed. This is due to my amazing friends, CCA, class and most importantly, the teachers. Every teacher in EJC made sure that their lessons were well-planned, and always made sure that their students are on track.

##### WHAT ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Sometimes, things may not go your way. What matters is that no matter how tough the road ahead is, facing it with the right attitude and mindset will help you achieve your goals. Do not give up!  My grades back in JC1 were certainly dismal, maybe you may feel the same way. Nonetheless, you should never allow that to hold you back. Instead, use it as motivation to push forward, improve yourself and constantly strive for the best!

**Elizabeth Teo (18-U2)** was an outstanding student in the classroom and who will also be remembered for her immense contributions to the dynamism that characterises Eunoia . As House Captain of Uzuri, she helped shape college culture through planning and executing house-related events such as Spartan Race, Inter-House Games and Road Run. During the College Opening in 2018, Elizabeth led her House Committee to design a house float that best embodied their House value of family. During Orientation 2019, she helped create House collaterals and mascots and planned House-related activities to create a strong House identity the JC1s could be inducted into. Elizabeth also served the college as a Student Councillor and planned large scale activities such as the House Forum, a college-wide feedback forum between the student population and the school leaders.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

Happy and thankful. The A-Level journey has been a long one, but the support of my family, friends and teachers definitely helped me through this journey. I am so grateful for extremely supportive peers, being blessed with amazing classmates and the very conducive study environment in school. The vast resources available online from our teachers and the study groups formed helped me immensely.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

In one word, fulfilling. EJC provided vast opportunities for me to develop myself as a person, from planning events and working with the house committee to volunteering in Chiang Mai. This journey would not have been possible without the support of my peers and teachers. I’m especially thankful to my civics tutor Mr Rodrigues and my life coach Mr Ganison!

##### WHAT ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

In everything you do, try your best! Embrace every learning opportunity and don’t forget to show your appreciation to those around you.

**Sebastian Koo Yong Jun (18-U2)** was a member of the EJC Media Club and his efforts meant major college events proceeded smoothly and were memorable. As the Head of the Audio-Visual (AV) module within the Media Club, Sebastian worked meticulously behind the scenes to ensure that the microphones and sound systems were in good working order. He served as the Media AV Support-in-Charge for key college events like the National Day and Teachers’ Day Celebrations, Orientation and the College Day Concert. Adapting carefully to the different logistical demands and technical support of each event, Sebastian and his team ensured Eunoians enjoyed each of these defining college experiences. 

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

My results met my expectations, so I am very pleased. Hard work and never giving up helped me achieve these.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

The 2 years I spent in EJC were filled with highs and lows. My friends, and my CCA, EJ Media, made it more meaningful for me.

##### WHAT ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

We are often told to strive for ‘work-life balance’, but it is important to accept this balance looks different at various points in the year. There will be times when you will need to put in more effort into studying. There will be times where you feel the need to spend more time on other projects or even for yourself and the people around you. It is okay to feel that way. It is also okay to feel lost, because life is all about not knowing anything initially, and seeking growth by learning from those around us. Failure is but a learning opportunity, and success is failure to fail.

**Goh Pei Swhen (18-U2)** served as a photographer for the Media Club, covering significant milestones in the college such as the College Orientation in 2019, National School Games ‘A’ Division competitions and award ceremonies. Her photojournalism allowed Eunoians who were not present at competitions to vicariously participate, support their peers and feel a sense of pride in the achievements and efforts of their peers. She helped Eunoians cherish the glories they defined for themselves.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I am very pleased with my results because I managed to have some fun every day despite the hectic JC life and did not neglect my mental and physical well-being even in the lead-up to exams. I think what helped me achieve my results was hard work and the teachers who never gave up on me even though I performed poorly on exams and tests. It also helped that I made sure to stay healthy and have sufficient rest. My friends also always had my back and readily lent me a helping hand also played an invaluable role in my results.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

I enjoyed school more in JC2 when I got more involved in college activities, such as serving as an OGL in Orientation. My family, my classmates, CCA mates, CCA teachers, Mr Rodrigues, Ms Lim Suan Chu, the friends I made in Orientation and my precious juniors all made the journey much more meaningful.

##### WHAT ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

We cannot escape the reality of needing to study hard in JC. It is important that you do not lag behind in your tutorials and clarify any doubts you have as soon as possible. Do not be too stressed about internal examinations; JC life is hectic and everyone learns at their own pace. Focus on the end goal that is the A-Level exams. Next, take some time to create memories in your JC life. There is more to life than just studying and grades. Please do create lots of these wonderful memories!

**Lim Jee Myang Daniel (18-I4)** exemplified beautiful thinking and goodwill to all in the way he channeled his innate curiosity to create opportunities for Eunoians to pursue their passions. He was Head of Special Projects in the EJC Visual Arts Club, a newly-minted CCA in 2018, and played an instrumental role in shaping the Club’s direction and identity. He was also the President of Makerspace, a place of innovation and creativity for students to work on a project of their choice. During the college Unconference Day 2018, Daniel organised an Escape Room that taught participants code-breaking as they worked through challenges. He also helped put EJC on the national radar when he led his team to first place at the SUTD Electric Vehicle Design Challenge 2019, a two-day event widely covered in the mainstream media. 

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

My results were a welcome surprise. I managed to improve significantly from my preliminary exams, and it is thanks in no small part to the support I received from my friends, teachers and family. I still remember my friends and I studying together and calling our Physics teacher to clarify our doubts. While we may have been interrupting his plans, he did not hesitate to field our queries. My peers kept me energised when we studied, and I don’t think I would have been able to keep my morale up through the entire journey without them.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My time in EJC has been the best two years of my schooling life so far. It was two years of slowly pushing my boundaries and showcasing what I am capable of achieving. From taking up a leadership role in a brand new CCA (the Visual Arts Club) to winning the Electric Vehicle Challenge and making it on the news, I have managed to go beyond what I once thought I could achieve. However, what really made the journey worth it was the people in EJC. Late-night Skype calls with my fellow CCA leaders and long hours in the Makerspace with my juniors are memories I hold on to. We got through times of hardship only because of our collective hard work. The strongest bonds are forged in fire, and our time spent together has left me with friendships that I wouldn’t trade for the world.

##### WHAT ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Be bold! Dare to do things that you are even a little interested in. For every success that I experienced, I met with two or more failures. It is important to push past failures and not let them affect you too much. Achievement will come if you try. So keep trying, and don't be discouraged. Keep fighting on!

**Tan Yi Juan Kimmie (18-E3)** exemplified all-round excellence and was a mainstay on the Dean's List (Academic) as well as the Dean’s List (Character and Service). As Vice-Captain for Eder House, she was instrumental in leading house segments during events like Road Run and College Day. Her careful planning and infectious enthusiasm played a valuable role in building house spirit and fostering bonding between seniors, juniors and teachers and helped Eunoians identify more strongly with the college. Kimmie was also a member of EJC Drama who attained a Distinction in a starring role at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in 2018.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

It still feels a bit surreal having just received my results half an hour ago. I am grateful to everyone who has been a part of my JC journey: my teachers, my family and my classmates who supported me tirelessly. My teachers who have truly been the greatest pillar of support, making lessons enjoyable and always supporting us even it meant losing their lunch break so we could have a consultation. I am also immensely lucky to have had such a loving and bonded class where we could strive together and help each other reach our fullest potential. Juggling school work with the duties that came with my leadership positions was difficult, and what helped me maintain balance in my life was proper prioritisation and taking breaks for as long as I needed in order to get back into a proper headspace to continue to do my best. Knowing what to do at the right time was something that helped make my JC life easier.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My time in Eunoia was full of ups and downs and there were many tears as well as much laughter. It has been memorable and an experience of a lifetime because of the people in school.  My very vibrant class was made up of vastly different individuals who became one big family because we accepted one another as we were and gave each other so much love and support. I am immensely thankful for everything they have done for me and went through with me. EJC has so many teachers that truly teach from the heart and are always trying to be innovative and improve so as to better help students understand. The care and effort they put into their work is truly admirable and made this tumultuous JC journey more smooth-sailing and manageable. Finally, my House and CCA have provided me with a sense of belonging and giving me the best memories through all the events. All these experiences have truly helped me to learn more about myself and the people around me so as to grow into the person I am today and I am grateful to EJC for giving me such good memories to walk away with.

##### WHAT ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

As much as the truth is harsh, this journey will not be easy and you cannot expect it to be easy. Academically, it will be gruelling and stressful. It is perfectly normal if you feel burned out at times. Take all the time you need to rest, recharge and start again. Your well-being is more important than the grades that appear on a piece of paper. Apart from all the academics in JC, don’t forget to truly enjoy yourself. JC is the best time to discover your strengths and interests. Find the friends in whom you can find solace and support as you go through this tumultuous period together. Be true to yourself and listen to your own needs. Take good care of yourself and remember that you are stronger than you think you are. You will be able to get through this and conquer everything else in life. All the best!
