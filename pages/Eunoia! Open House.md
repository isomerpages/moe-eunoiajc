### Best of You

It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Our **Open House** is back and we’re more ready than ever to welcome you to our home in Bishan. Discover exciting CCAs, exhilarating performances, extraordinary programmes and exceptional people who'll turn trying moments into **the best of times**.

Eunoia has the greatest hits but we're missing our biggest piece — **you!** Find the best of us and make the best of you on **13 Jan, 9 am to 4 pm**.

### Programme

Hear from our **Principal**, Mr Andrew Tan and our Eunoians about their #WhyEJ. Feel our shining school spirit at our **CCA and House Showcases**, and be swept away by the performances at our **Aesthetics Showcase**. Take a look around our **campus**, and make yourself at home!
