The college held its second ever Road Run at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park II on 23 March 2018, bringing parents, JC1 and JC2 students and staff together for a day under the sun. Parents@Eunoia was in full force to support the students too, providing a post-run snack for student, staff and parent participants.

It would be the first major house event of the year, with JC1 and JC2s alike donning new house t-shirts featuring the house crests designed by Kay Yeung and Alexandra Chin. Also new to the doubly healthy competition was a totem pole competition. Students ran with house flags and various components of their house structure, assembling them at the end. Uzuri house's tall, fearsome bear statue won them the honours, and Akila house ably flew over the rest of the competition to emerge champions of the race segment.
