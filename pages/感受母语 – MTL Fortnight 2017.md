From 3 to 7 April, the college's Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department held the first half of MTL Fortnight 2017. Launched with aplomb by the sound of a gong, the activities held during the week promised our Eunoians that they would 感受母语.

The week would kick off with a calligraphy workshop at the Atria, led by our China Studies in Chinese teacher Mr Cao Jiandong, as well as a Calligraphy competition overseen by Deputy Head (MTL) Ms Yang Shu Hung and team.

The cultural activities continued all through the week, driven by our Eunoians' enthusiasm for the _batik_ painting session led by Ms Nadira,  the art of _kolam_ led by Mrs Uma Thiruselvam and dumpling making with our master chefs Mr Yao Zhanxin and Mdm Chen Lili.

The week closed with a _xinyao_ singing session by students and staff that brought the college community closer through song, and closer to our cultural roots as well.

The next half of the MTL Fortnight will be held in Term 3, and we are certainly looking forward to seeing, hearing, feeling and appreciating more of our three main Mother Tongue Languages and the traditions we hold close to each of them.
