On the eve of National Day, both JC1 and JC2 levels gathered to celebrate the nation's 53rd birthday and took the chance to show their house spirit in the college's 2nd Inter-House Games.

The morning drizzle did little to dampen to the national pride. With the observance ceremony was shifted indoors to the multi-purpose hall, students from the various Uniform Groups marched in with aplomb before Principal, Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng delivered a National Day message from Minister for Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung. In the message, Mr Ong reflected on 2018 remake of We Are Singapore, and how it stood for the mix of the familiar and ceaseless reinvention the nation undergoes.

Reinvent and rework our student leaders did, declaring the start of the Inter-House Games with a colourful bang. This year's rendition would see the return of a few sports and introduction of traditional games to mark the occasion. Students from the five houses competed in the finals for basketball, badminton, floorball, netball and ultimate frisbee, while also engaging each other in chapteh, hopscotch and even a large-scale version of five stones.

After the friendly competition, the college gathered back as one to commemorate National Day with a sing-along session. Accompanied by Mr Xie Zhizhong on the keyboard and Mr Jonathan Lee on drums, student performers led the school to sing familiar favourites such as Home, Reach Out for the Skies and Love at First Light.

Rocking the house next were the house cheers competition, which brought the dancing talent from all their representatives on stage. Even the teachers from Akila house flew in to take part in the cheering — Akila would eventually win the cheer competition, with Eder house taking home the Inter-House Games trophy for their verve on stage and on the court.
