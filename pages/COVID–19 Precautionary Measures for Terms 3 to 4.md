As our country makes a gradual exit from Circuit Breaker, and as we welcome Eunoians back from Home Based Learning and the May holidays, we remain mindful of the continued need to ensure the safety of our staff and students. The college has put in place a suite of safe management measures, described below, which will be strictly enforced until further notice.

### Reducing Number of Students in School

Each day, only one cohort of students will return to school for face-to-face lessons. Students would engage in Home Based Learning on days where they are not in school.

### Stay Home Notice / Leave of Absence / Approved Absence

All students returning from overseas, regardless of country or mode of entry, on or after 14 March 2020 have been / will be served a 14-day Stay Home Notice by ICA. The day of arrival will count as Day 0.

If a student or member of staff is staying in the same household as an individual on Home Quarantine Order (HQO) or Stay Home Notice (SHN), he or she must inform the school immediately. He or she will be placed on Leave of Absence for the duration of the HQO/SHN.

If a student or member of staff is staying in the same household as an adult on Medical Leave for flu-like symptoms (e.g. cough, fever), he or she must inform the school immediately. He or she will be placed on Approved Absence (AA) for the duration of the Medical Leave.

All students on Stay-Home Notice, LOA or AA will be supported with Home Based Learning.

### Temperature Screening and Visitor Management

All staff and students take their temperatures twice daily, in the morning and again at 3 pm.

All visitors to the school are required to take their temperature, complete a Visitor Declaration form and check-in on the SafeEntry system (by using a QR Code reader or by scanning their ID). These include parents who drive into school to pick up their children. Visitors should check-out on the SafeEntry system as they exit the college.

Any visitors with a fever or flu-like symptoms would not be allowed entry into the college.

### Safe Management on Campus

All students and staff are expected to wear a face mask when in college, except meal times and PE lessons. Teachers can use face shields instead of masks when teaching, and while maintaining a safe distance from students.

Students proceed directly to classrooms when they arrive in school for the flag-raising ceremony.

Students have fixed exam-style seating in class. Materials are provided for wipe-down routine.

Lectures have been replaced by lecture recordings to be viewed on HBL days.
