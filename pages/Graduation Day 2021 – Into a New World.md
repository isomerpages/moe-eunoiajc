The Class of 2021 marked the end of their two-year journey in the college on 22 Oct 2021. All 27 civic groups gathered in their classrooms in line with safe management measures, but the 600-strong cohort still felt the spirit of one Eunoia.

The ceremony gave time for our Eunoians to reflect on their journey, congratulate batchmates who received Commendation Awards for individual subjects and Best Progress, and cheer their peers on the Dean's List (Academic) and Dean's List (Character & Service) in the classroom.

It was also an entertaining affair with an inter-class competition based on Wheel of Fortune and pre-recorded teacher performances, set alight by a rousing dance by Ms Chia Hui Ping, Ms Heon Mak, Ms Tan Fangxi and Mdm Tan Lingmin, a smooth rendition of 'Butter' by the Mathematics Department and scintillating examination tips from the Economics team.

More words of wisdom and encouragement were to follow from the Dean's Address by Mr Ganison Rajamohan and speeches by the respective Valedictorians for the Arts and Science streams, Rachel Grace Ong (20-U1) and Lim Tian Le (20-A2).

The ceremony would not be complete without the presentation of the gold collar pins, pinned onto graduands by the Civics Tutors of each class. While not a moment for euphoria, it was an emotional - and sweet - conclusion to the Class of 2021's journey in Eunoia.
