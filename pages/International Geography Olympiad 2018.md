Our Eunoian Cheryl Yong Kai Lin (18-A4) flew the Singapore flag high at the International Geography Olympiad, held in Quebec, Canada on 8 Aug 2018, clinching 2nd place with her team. Cheryl, an alumna of Singapore Chinese Girls' School (SCGS), was part of the team with Rafflesians Heng Junxiang, Fang Yihang and Royden Soh.

We interviewed Cheryl to hear her thoughts on the experience:

##### WHAT DID THE EXPERIENCE MEAN TO YOU?

Winning a medal at the Olympiad was a great source of encouragement for me.  There was a lot of time and hard work put into the training, and I'm glad that we achieved what we did.

Geography intrigues me — it is a subject that is applicable and observable in our daily lives. My favourite part about the subject is doing fieldwork, as it really brings Geography to life!

##### WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THE OLYMPIAD?

I have definitely learnt a lot in the academic sense and realised how varied landscapes across the world are. On a personal level, I have become more confident about what I can achieve with the right effort and with teamwork. I definitely could not have achieved as much without the help of my teammates as we shared knowledge and encouraged each other.

Besides gaining experience from the competition itself, I think my greatest takeaway was the friendships I have forged, be it with my teammates or geographers from other countries. I made many new international friends and learned a lot about their culture and country.

##### WHAT ARE YOU GRATEFUL FOR?

I would like to thank my teachers in SCGS giving me the opportunity to embark on this amazing journey, as well as my teachers in EJC for their understanding, encouragement and support over the last seven months to help me keep up with work and prepare for the competition.

I am also thankful for my CCA mates and classmates for helping to cover my responsibilities during my absence and helping me catch up on schoolwork! I am very grateful for my friends and family for being my cheerleaders, especially my parents for always making sure I stayed happy and healthy. Most importantly, I would like to thank my teammates and team leaders for making this journey so fun and fruitful!
