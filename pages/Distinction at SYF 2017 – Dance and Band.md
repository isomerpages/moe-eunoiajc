The college would like to congratulate students and teachers-in-charge from our Dance and Symphonic Band CCAs for their stellar performance at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2017 Arts Presentation.

Both performing arts groups clinched the SYF Certificate of Distinction on the back of 2-3 intense months of rehearsals and background work. Their effort, passion and the courage to step up to the challenge with only one cohort of student-performers is worthy of commendation.

Their achievements would also not have been possible without the support of the community. On behalf of Dance and Symphonic Band, the college would like to thank all Eunoians, parents, staff and most of all, the Dance and Band instructors for their support and guidance on our collective journey towards excellence.
