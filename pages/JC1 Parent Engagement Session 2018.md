Dear Parents,

We would like to invite you to our JC1 Parent Engagement Session. Through this meeting, we hope to establish stronger partnerships with parents to help in the holistic development of Eunoians. During the session, we will share the academic and co-curricular requirements for JC1 students, for you to gain a better understanding of the curriculum in EJC. You will also have the opportunity to hear from your child / ward’s Civics Tutor and attend one of three concurrent information sessions, where you can learn more about our college programmes and the support structures in place to nurture our Eunoians.

The details of the event are as follows:

Date:         23 February 2018 (Friday)

Time:         5:30pm – 7.30pm

Venue:       Multi-Purpose Hall, Eunoia Junior College

_A guided tour of the college campus will commence from 4:45pm for parents who have signed up for it._ _In the event that parking space within the college is not available, please park your vehicle at the nearby multistorey carparks._

I would also like to provide a brief overview of the Parent-Teacher Meeting (PTM) sessions through the course of your child / ward’s journey in Eunoia Junior College.
