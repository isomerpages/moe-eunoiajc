Decked in house colours for the first time, Eunoians and teachers kicked off the inaugural Sports Day and Inter-House Games on 24 July 2017.

The Eunoia community, under the stewardship of the five House committees and Sports representatives, participated in a kaleidoscope of activities that included Track and Field events, Ultimate Frisbee, Floorball, Street Basketball, Robotics, Chinese Chess, Chess, Soccer and Street Netball. Our staff and parents were there in full force as well, participating in staff and mixed relays with almost as much aplomb as our effervescent Eunoians.

Generating heat of their own indoors, student-leaders led a cheering contest between the five houses, Akila, Eder, Isami, Ora and Uzuri. Eder eventually emerged the winner of the Inter-House Championship after some intense competition, but it was Eunoia unity that won the day.
