In preparation for the Chinese New Year festivities, our Eunoians picked up their cleaning weapons for a campus cleanliness crusade on 26 Jan 2017. Our students brought their brooms and mops to give our LTs, science laboratories, floors, fans, rooms and railings a fresh face for the new year. Our teachers too joined in the act to make it a complete Eunoia family affair! Urged on by Ms. Liu Lijun and the Character & Citizenship Education committee, our college community came together to show some love not just for our new house, but also the cleaning uncles and aunties who put in their best every day to make it our home.
