The college is ready to welcome its first ever cohort of students, formed by students from both the 'O' Level track and the Joint Integrated Programme. The 2017 Joint Admissions Exercise, which will take place after the release of the 'O' Level results, is the first the college will be taking part in. From our outreach efforts at various secondary schools, students have asked us questions about admission and other matters pertaining to the college's first year; we share our responses here.

For details on our programmes, you may refer to our [**online prospectus**](https://issuu.com/eunoiajc/docs/beautiful_thinking), download a [**PDF**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/EJC-Prospectus-2017-18.pdf) version of the prospectus, or find the relevant information on our [**Curriculum**](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/) page.

We would also like to invite students receiving their 'O' Level results in 2017 to email us at [**eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg**](mailto:eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg) with questions you may have, and visit us at our upcoming **[Open House](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/oh-eunoia-2017/)** on 13 Jan 2017. Join us as the First Class of Eunoians, who will be part of a first-class educational experience and make the Eunoia legacy one unlike any other.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is the cut-off point for the 2017 Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) intake?  

A: The cut-off point for each year is determined only after the end of JAE in that year. It is based on the highest successful L1R5 aggregate score received by the respective course in each school. There is no point of reference from the 2016 JAE as the college will only receive its first cohort of students in 2017. The cut-off point for each course varies from year to year, depending on the number and quality of applicants. We do expect strong competition for entry due to our limited number of vacancies.

Q: I heard that students in the Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) start school in January, while ‘O’ Level students will only enter in February. What will happen during the month of January?  

A: Students in the JIP will be engaged in a series of preparatory, enrichment and culture-building activities. The teaching and learning of core content will begin when students are admitted via JAE.

Q: Will students admitted via JAE be disadvantaged when it comes to the choice of subject combinations?  

A: No. Students admitted via JAE will not be disadvantaged in terms of their selection of subject combinations. The college does not distinguish between JIP students and JAE students in its allocation of subject combinations.

Q: Will JAE students be placed in separate classes from JIP students?  

A: No, the college strongly believes in the value of diversity in and outside the classroom. Every student in the college is a Eunoian; the college seeks to integrate students from the Joint Integrated Programme with students from the ‘O’ Level programme at various schools.

Q: I heard that JIP students are allowed to initiate CCAs outside the college’s current list and submit their ideas on various items like the uniform. Will JAE students also be given the opportunity to do so?  

A: The college strongly believes in student voice, and seeks to empower all students with the skills and opportunities to exercise their voice. Students admitted via JAE will be given ample opportunities to influence college programmes, including proposing and setting up new CCAs.

Q: I am interested in a CCA that is offered by several JCs but is not listed in EJC’s CCA list for 2017. How did EJC determine the list of CCAs?  

A: The list of CCAs for 2017 was based on many factors including interest from our JIP students. The number of CCAs in EJC will increase over the next few years. Our students will have the opportunity to shape their CCA experience and to initiate new CCAs.

Q: What is Eunoia’s approach to learning?  

A: The college is invested in the areas of educational neuroscience, educational psychology and life coaching. Our learning programmes are designed based on educational research and our teachers constantly develop themselves in these areas. Eunoia teachers understand how learning takes place, and design our classroom lessons to engage, intrigue and inspire our students.

Q: When will the college uniform be ready?  

A: The uniform will be available for purchase when the college welcomes its first cohort of students in January 2017.

Q: Where will the college be located? Is the campus ready?  

A: The college will be situated at our Mount Sinai campus from 2017 to 2019 and our permanent Bishan campus, located along Sin Ming Drive, from 2020 onwards. The Mount Sinai campus is currently undergoing rejuvenation works and will be ready by the end of 2016.
