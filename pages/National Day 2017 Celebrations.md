It was quite the birthday party for a nation 52 years young, celebrated by a junior college young in spirit on 8 Aug 2017.

The day began with our uniformed group leaders marching in with our national flag, college flag, gusto and pride. The Eunoia Symphonic Band was present in full force throughout the National Day Observance Ceremony, accompanying the student-leaders in their march-in and the college community as we sang the National Anthem. This was followed by the recitation of the pledge, and a reading of the [**National Day Message**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/speeches/national-day-message-by-mr-ng-chee-meng--minister-for-education-schools--at-the-national-day-observance-ceremony-in-schools) from Minister for Education (Schools) Mr Ng Chee Meng by our Principal Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng. In his message, Minister Ng affirmed the nation's commitment to National Service on the fiftieth anniversary of the National Service Bill being passed, as well as the commitment of NSmen and their families who together have ensured the safety and security of Singapore.

His call for Singaporeans to strengthen the Singaporean identity would not go unheard. The Best of You exhibition in the college featured stories of resilience from the nation's pioneer leaders and our first cohort of Eunoians. The #GhimmeMohHands Instagram Challenge encouraged Eunoians to engage the Ghim Moh community in the college's National Day celebrations. The proceeds from the day's festivities would be channelled towards bursaries for needy students in the college. Project Mind Matters, a student group from the college, also raised funds for mental health awareness in collaboration with Silver Ribbon and Youth Corps.

No celebration would be complete without food, fun and a flash mob. At the first-ever Eunoia Fiesta Village, our students in their Civics Groups and CCAs turned their innovative ideas into reality.  Bubble tea, popiah from Ghim Moh, traditional biscuits, soya bean milk, potato wheel snacks and many more delights formed a real buffet spread to whet any appetite. There were plenty of activities to work off a few calories too, ranging from a five stones challenge for the nostalgia-hunters to a haunted play-house for the thrill-seekers. Harmony was the running theme, especially at the school field, transformed into a raucous Festival of Colours by the luminescent EJC Drama society.

With two classic National Day songs, our resident student band vivified our national pride, which was expressed just as wonderfully by 52 Eunoians dancing their hearts out. Our teachers were inspired too, with our Head of Mathematics Mr Alvin Toh and Music teacher Mr Xie Zhizhong busking at the Atria earlier in the day.

National Day is a reminder that all citizens have a part to play in Singapore's present and future narrative. As students, parents, teachers and staff, the college pledged their commitment to building #OneNationTogether to bring the celebrations to a fitting end.
