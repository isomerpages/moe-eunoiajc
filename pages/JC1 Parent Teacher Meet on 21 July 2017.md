Dear Parents,

On 24 February 2017, we invited all parents to our first JC1 Parent-Teacher Meet, where we hope you gained a better understanding of the JC curriculum and its academic as well as non-academic requirements at JC1.

To facilitate a more in-depth conversation between you, your child/ward and his/her Civics Tutor(s), we would like to invite you to the second JC1 Parent-Teacher Meet. The details of the event are as follows:

**Date**: 21 July 2017 (Fri)

**Time**: One 15-minute slot between 5.00pm – 7.45pm\*

**Venue**: Eunoia Junior College (Multi-purpose Hall)

Consultation with subject tutors will be between 8.00pm and 8.45pm

During the session, your child/ward’s Civics Tutor will update you on your child/ward’s progress in his/her course. As the session will take the form of a student-led conference, your child/ward is expected to be present during the meeting. Subject tutors will be available between 8.00pm to 8.45pm, if you would like to approach them for subject-related matters.

To sign up for the 15-minute conversation slot with your child/ward’s Civics Tutor, please log on to MC Online <**[http://mconline.sg](http://mconline.sg/)**\> with the parent account, which was shared with you during the previous PTM. Your child/ward will also be able to sign up for the slot on your behalf using their own account. The sign-up period is 6 - 14 July.

Please be informed that the registration for the slot is on a first-come first-served basis. To respect the time of all parents, we seek your understanding to arrive on time for the slot you signed up for and keep to the 15-minute duration.

If you are unable to meet the schedule provided but would like to communicate with the teachers, please feel free to email your child/ward’s Civics Tutors, who will be able to engage you over a phone call or email. You may find their e-mail addresses at [**/about/staff-directory**](/about/staff-directory).

We look forward to meeting you during the event.

Thank you.
