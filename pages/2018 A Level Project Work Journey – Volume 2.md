Our second cohort of Eunoians received their A-Level Project Work results on 16 Apr 2019 and have charted the way forward for the college and for themselves with their excellent performance.¬†Ms Adrienne de Souza, Head of Department (Project Work & Flagship Programmes) said,

> "The 2018 cohort has performed tremendously. They learned to collaborate, pitch their ideas, negotiate them and express them beautifully, all while discovering and appreciating each other's strengths. They have proven that Project Work is about connecting the mind and heart, and bringing courage towards their purpose. In future, I hope that our Eunoians will use the skills they have learned in Project Work to solve real problems, and help make our communities, our country and our world a better place for all."

To map our Eunoians' growth, we interviewed three more groups of students from 18-I1, 18-O2 and 18-I3 to learn more about their experience, the purpose they found and the connections they made along the way.

###### WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT ABOUT AND WHY DID THE GROUP PURSUE THIS?

**Solomon Chua**: We chose to focus on the issue of foster care in Singapore, or more specifically, the lack of foster parents willing to foster older children (aged 11-17). I am personally invested in this issue as my family is involved in the foster care system which has exposed me to the problems foster children face as they grow up. As such, I felt that foster care would be a meaningful topic to pursue and I‚Äôm glad that my group mates felt the same way as I did.

###### WHAT MADE THE PROJECT WORK JOURNEY MEANINGFUL FOR YOU?

**Tan Wen Xin**: Our PW journey was very meaningful as it allowed me to put myself into the shoes of foster parents and understand the issue from their perspectives, as well as other related stakeholders, which I would not have gotten to experience otherwise. While this journey of ours has been extremely enriching as we carried a ‚ÄòPractice till Perfection'¬†mentality and the spirit of excellence, my biggest takeaway would be the feeling of 4 other amazing individuals that became a group of people that I am most comfortable with. From the moment we left the exam hall, our group knew that the results don‚Äôt matter as much as the journey we had, simply because the journey had been a most fulfilling one for us.

**Hazel Wong**: I think the most meaningful part is the process of putting our written report together. We really reflected a lot and put ourselves in the shoes of foster parents at this phase of the project as we cannot merely come up with a solution that is convenient for us. We needed to consider the perspectives of our target group. I also have a newfound respect for foster parents as despite it being a thankless job, they are persevering on.

**Zoelynn Wong**: Looking back, the most vivid memories I could think of were, firstly, the whole process of filming the short introduction video for our slides together, and secondly slaving through our written report at 7pm in F1-11 during PW ASAP that one time after we, all of us together, procrastinated, forgot to do and subsequently did subpar work in our written report, disappointing our PW tutor. One memory showed me how fun it was actually to work on something with my PW group mates, the other memory taught me that success comes only from discipline and hard work. Both memories, however, taught me the value of friendship within a team, even if your team consists of people you don‚Äôt talk to normally, who aren‚Äôt necessarily in your ‚Äúclique‚Äù.

**Freya Keertikar**: To be frank, a lot of the memories that I have of the entire PW process have been a blur because it all happened so fast and yet I can still remember every single emotion that we felt, be it disappointment when our work did not meet expectations or the joy and satisfaction we felt when we finished our Oral Presentation and knew that it was the best we could have ever done. To me, all these experiences taught be the power of being a collective, because every single one of these emotions was felt by every single one of us and we shared our burdens, managing to ride this rollercoaster together. It was something that we hardly ever experience in our lifetimes and the entire PW process truly taught me that being in a group isn‚Äôt just about looking out for yourself, it‚Äôs about facing together and living up to the spirit of ‚ÄòAll for one, and one for all‚Äô. We entered the group as just classmates, but at the end of the day, we came out as true friends tied by a shared experience and that is a phenomenon that is hard to ever recreate.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR JUNIORS?

**Tan Wen Xin**: Believe in yourself, your group mates, and most importantly, the project you are embarking on! Only when you believe it is meaningful to pursue the cause, then will your journey be a fulfilling one üôÇ

**Hazel Wong**: Put in your best effort at every step of the project and only make decisions as a group!

**Zoelynn Wong**: Be open to the topics you do for PW. Be open to suggestions from your teammates. The most important thing in any group work is to be a team, come to a consensus, work together, encourage each other, listen to each other (and be prepared to at the very worst switch your entire project around midway through it).

**Freya Keertikar**: Play your cards right. Be extremely clear of what you need to do and listen to your teacher but also listen to your intuition. Settle any differences within your group early on and know that this whole process is your team versus Project Work, not you versus someone else in the group. Care for each other at every step and know that success isn‚Äôt mutually exclusive ie someone else doesn‚Äôt need to be worse than you in order for you to do well so don‚Äôt drag others down and be the best version of yourself, everyone‚Äôs success is your success too.

###### WHO WOULD THE GROUP LIKE TO THANK?

**Tan Wen Xin**: We would really like to thank the teachers, friends and interviewees who have supported us thus far, especially Mr Omar, for all the valuable insights that they had given, that I feel have extended beyond our Foster Care project and has somehow impacted our lives in one way or another.

**Freya Keertikar**: To elaborate on Wen Xin‚Äôs point, we are truly grateful that we had a tutor who gave us so much support and yet showed tough love when we were straying and a lot of what we achieved was due to his belief in us. We are also truly thankful to our class, 18-I1, for looking out for each other and helping those in other groups thus helping to create a non-competitive environment where we all lifted each other up so that we could all succeed together as a class.

###### WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT ABOUT AND WHY DID THE GROUP PURSUE THIS?

**Joey Lim**: Our project was about children aged 1-6 drowning in Singapore‚Äôs condominium private pools. We created a 3 prong approach to help overcome this crisis tackling the issue from various perspectives. Originally, our group was put together because we were the ones in the class that came up with weird ideas that did not fit with the others. Ranging from helping construction workers spines to dental health, we had the difficult task of narrowing down what crisis we wanted to tackle. One of our group members was actually a licensed lifeguard and suggested doing a project on children drowning in Singapore. After doing a bit of research and watching horrifying videos of children drowning silently with their guardians right beside them, it greatly concerned many of us in the group as most of us had younger siblings that we could picture as the drowning child. Hence, we decided to go with what we were most passionate about and tackle the growing crisis of children drowning in Singapore.

###### WHAT MADE THE PROJECT WORK JOURNEY MEANINGFUL FOR YOU?

**Elijah Chia**: What made the PW journey meaningful for me were the techniques I learnt in the process. For instance, I learnt to make more insightful deductions and evaluations of the project and the problem through the I&R segment, and to assess the reliability of sources through the WR. I also learnt to appreciate and empathise with the issues which minorities face which are largely kept under the radar by society. Furthermore, I also learnt that pre-existing solutions can be a template for us to derive meaningful learning points, which can lay the foundation for future solutions in a wide range of subjects. Most importantly, I learnt to appreciate the limits of collaboration in the form of conflicts of opinions and schedules, and how to challenge those limits by utilising each other‚Äôs strengths.

**Chong Min Han**: The most meaningful and appreciative aspect that I would take away from my PW journey is undoubtedly the people. Personally, I had always preferred to work alone as I find it to be more efficient and quicker way of solving problems. However, through working with my group mates, I realised that even though we weren‚Äôt on the same page all the time and though we weren‚Äôt the most efficient bunch of people, the process of formulating solutions for complex and abstract problems and more importantly, seeing the group, grow and progress as one, was something which was a hundred times more meaningful and rewarding than going on the journey alone. As cliche as it may sound, I guess PW made be truly realise the saying of ‚Äòif you want to go fast go alone; if you want to go far go together‚Äô and I really appreciate my group mates for making my PW journey something worth remembering.

**Koh Zi Yi**: PW was a meaningful journey that provided me with various opportunities to grow and learn as a student. I learnt to actively seek out answers and to be intellectually curious about things around me. Through this, I acquired many skills such as integrating and applying knowledge from different sources to evaluate ideas. This developed my problem solving skills and taught me to think creatively in order to generate ideas to improve on existing solutions. Although working closely as a group was tough at the start, after getting to know one another better, we were able to confidently speak out minds, compromise and work off our individual strengths towards a common goal. Not only did I acquire various useful skills such as collaboration, but I also learnt how to communicate ideas effectively to an audience. We had to pitch our ideas verbally during our OP and through the written form via our WR.

**Vera Lee**:¬†One thing that made PW meaningful for me was finding out the issues my batchmates had chosen to tackle for their various projects. By simply asking my friends what the gist of their project was, or listening to them memorising and reciting their OP scripts, I was exposed to many issues in society that have yet to be addressed, which allowed me to learn more about the impact of these significant problems on our daily lives that I previously would not have considered. However, more importantly, I learnt to appreciate my group‚Äôs collaborative effort to produce a piece of work that we would be proud to present at the end of the year. I appreciate that every member of this team understood from the beginning that we had to make the effort to voice our opinions, meet deadlines and contribute equally in order to pull it off. Over our time spent together, they taught me to communicate more effectively, to become a better listener and to think out of the box.

**Joey Lim**: The most useful thing I learnt was how to be resourceful. As a lifeguard, I had actual contacts that I could consult in order to gain new insights or ideas on how to modify our project. In the beginning I was very hesitant about contacting them choosing instead to rely on research online or from the lifeguard booklet. However some things that you need to learn are just not able to be found on text but rather you need to actually sit down with someone who has experienced it and talk to them. So, after my lifeguard trainings, I would take half an hour to talk to my lifeguard coach, trying to gain new insights. I would go up to parents who sent their 1-7 year olds for swimming lessons and ask them questions. At first, I was sure that they would ignore me but as the saying goes, ‚Äúyou never know unless you try‚Äù. The people I interacted with were actually very open to sharing whatever information they knew and were really interested in the project that we were doing. My lifeguard coach even lent us his Mini Annie (A CPR training dummy) to use during our Oral Presentation. So at the end of the day, I learnt to use whatever resources I had to its fullest, be grateful when you do receive help from strangers and to never think that something is impossible until you try it yourself.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR JUNIORS?

**Elijah Chia**: I believe that the most important criterion in determining PW success is preparation. This extends to all segments of PW. Have as many rounds of vetting of your WR and I&R and as possible, constantly refer to an assortment of model WRs to elicit possible areas of improvement, rehearse your OP frequently, and create a question bank which is as big as possible. These preparations lay the foundation for any possible criticisms you may encounter during the actual marking of your PW. In addition, learn to collaborate with those outside your group as well; share question banks with other groups in order to obtain a wider range of questions.

**Joey Lim**: Honestly there is a hundred and one things that I would tell my juniors to look out for. But the most important thing I would say is to set deadlines. Regardless of if they are short deadlines, spanning a week, or long deadlines, spanning a term, always have a goal that you set for yourself and your team. Project Work is a marathon. If you aimlessly try to get through the year without setting any deadlines on what to complete, you will ultimately be as lost as you will feel. Always write down what needs to be done, changed or rewritten. Assign it specifically to your members and try to set a meeting with your teammates at the end of the week via an actual meetup or skype so that its a pseudo checkpoint that forces you and your teammates to complete the work you have to do. Personally, my group had at least 4 long term lists of deadlines and more than 8 short term lists that we followed. In each one we listed down what work we need to prioritise and what would be an added bonus to have if we could implement it in. This helped to not only make sure our work was completed without conflicting with our exams, but also helped us set an agenda for our meetups so that we know what we have to discuss and actually manage to sleep at a decent time. ¬†

###### WHO WOULD THE GROUP LIKE TO THANK?

**Chong Min Han**: We would like to thank Mrs Cyndi, managing agent of Nouvelle Management Property Solutions Pte Ltd and Mr Ho, a professional lifeguard for the patience they had when answering our interview questions. Firstly, they took time off their busy schedule to help us with our primary research. Secondly, our group‚Äôs topic was about drowning in Singapore condominium private pools, which was understandably a very abstract topic to those not familiar with the topic. Nonetheless, they tried their best in answering the questions and gave valuable insights with the knowledge they had regarding the topic. Thirdly, they were even willing to help advocate on our cause as they too felt that our topic was one which more people should be talking about. This action, though small, really motivated the group as it helped us realise that our cause was truly something worth fighting for.

**Koh Zi Yi**: We would like to thank our classmates for all the support and encouragement they have shown us throughout this journey. From the very start of our PW journey, our classmates have been very supportive of one another. They would voluntarily pitch ideas and provide various points of view or comments after reading our WR. Even after listening to our OP presentation a thousand times, our classmates would never failed to give constructive criticism and advice each time to help us improve on our presentation. The creation of a class question bank also played a big part in our preparations for OP, and we are eternally grateful for joint effort of the class. Their words of affirmation and encouragement never failed to push us through the woes of PW. Thank you for always believing in us.

**Vera Lee**: We would like to thank our PW tutor, Ms Sonia for her guidance and patience throughout this arduous process. She put in a lot of effort in reviewing our WR, OP and I&Rs many times and did it all very quickly in an attempt to give us as much time as possible to improve our work. Although it was frustrating, she always provided us with new questions and perspectives to help perfect our content. On top of the workload, Ms Sonia also consciously checked on our well-being, showering us with a lot of support and encouragement to push us along, and for that we are very grateful to her. We would also like to thank the other two groups in our OP slot, EJ062 and EJ101 for the many dry runs together, from which we gained a lot of insight and feedback on how we could improve our presentation skills, and for the comforting smiles and active participation when we finally presented our work to the assessors.

###### WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT ABOUT AND WHY DID THE GROUP PURSUE THIS?

**Andrea Lim**: Our project focuses on identifying and tackling misinformation amongst youth on social media. We did this through roadshows, animations and games to inform members of the public, especially youth, the dangers of misinformation and how to prevent it. We chose this project because we found it prevalent in our society today. Social media is one of the fastest ways to spread and share information - as well as fake news. By identifying youths aged 15-24 as the largest and most active group on social media such as WhatsApp and Instagram, we can therefore spread awareness of misinformation to people with the highest exposure to it.

###### WHAT MADE THE PROJECT WORK JOURNEY MEANINGFUL FOR YOU?

**Jerric Chan**: I think that the various experiences made the PW journey meaningful for my group. Such experiences include going out to different places to collect data, interviewing professionals and some of the simple discussions that we had. Through this project, I learnt how to work with my different group mates and how to utilise the unique talents of each group member.

**Nicole Tan**: I feel that what made the PW journey meaningful was my group mates. The PW journey was definitely not an easy one but having a supportive and easy-going bunch of group mates was really what made all the late night Skype calls, meet-ups and gathering of primary research worth it. I learnt that unity is strength and to go far, collaboration and listening to everyone‚Äôs opinions is key. ‚ÄúTeamwork makes the dream work‚Äù, as cliche as it may sound I believe that this is the true embodiment of what makes PW so fulfilling. Moreover, I gained a deep found understanding of my topic, misinformation and its spread on social media, which was definitely interesting to learn about.

**Sujitha**: I feel that, among other things, working on an interesting topic was what that made PW journey meaningful. We all knew fake news was already an issue but I personally did not know the extent of the issue. As such, I did learn a lot about the extent of misinformation in Singapore. It was really an eye-opening experience as a lot of what I learnt through our project was very applicable to my current lifestyle too, being a young adult myself.

###### WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR JUNIORS?

**Jerric**¬†**Chan**: Accept your group members for who they are and use each member‚Äôs strengths to complete different parts of the project. Also ensure that you discuss your ideas with your group members and your teachers before writing it into the draft. Most importantly, do not fight with your group members and have fun!

**Nicole Tan**: Although at first it may seem like there is a lot of time to meet deadlines, time really flies by! Don‚Äôt procrastinate and try to plan ahead and stay on task. Also, from the start try not to let your word count build up. Make your drafts concise, with only the relevant information put in as having to cut down on words towards the end of your project is an arduous task. Overall, know that you‚Äôre not alone in this journey and don‚Äôt be afraid to approach your teachers, seniors, or other group members for help. Believe in yourselves!

###### WHO WOULD THE GROUP LIKE TO THANK?

**Jerric Chan**: Our group would like to thank Ms Rani, our PW teacher. We are very grateful for the very relevant and insightful comments and also thankful for prompt return of our drafts which allowed us to do our work so much more efficiently. Without the endless guidance and support from Ms Rani, we would probably not have been able to do well in PW.

**Nicole Tan**: We would like to thank Professor Lim Sun Sun (Professor of Media and Communication and Head of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences) for taking time off of her busy schedule to have an interview with us. Her sincerity and patience in helping us was admirable and she no doubt provided us with valuable insights on our project. We are grateful for her suggestions and comments that really helped us to improve our project. On top of that, we would also like to thank the members of the public who took time to help us do our surveys, especially since our first survey required quite a bit of time for them to do it.
