**Dear Parents of our JC1 students,**

We would like to invite you to the inaugural Parent-Teacher Meet. You should receive a printed letter issued on 3 February 2017 (Friday) from your child. The details of the event are as follows:

**Date**: 24 February 2017 (Friday)

**Time**\*: 6.00pm – 7.30pm

**Venue**: Multi-Purpose Hall, Eunoia Junior College

\*A guided tour of the college campus will commence from 5.15pm for interested parents. Parents may register via the printed copy of the invitation letter.

During the session, we will share the academic and non-academic requirements for JC1 students, for you to gain a better understanding of the curriculum in EJC. You will also have the opportunity to meet your child / ward’s Civics Tutor.

To confirm your attendance, please complete and return the bottom section of this letter through your child / ward by 8 February 2017 (Wednesday). Please also indicate if you would be driving to the college, so that we can better anticipate parking needs. In the event that parking space within the college is not available, you may park your vehicle at the nearby multi-storey carparks.

We look forward to meeting you during the event and partnering you in your child / ward’s journey here at Eunoia Junior College.

Thank you.
