In September 2016, the college held a pre-opening engagement session for parents of our first cohort of students. At this session, we received our parents' well wishes for their child, and the cohort of Eunoians who will chart the way forward for the college. In the months of November and December 2016, the staff and alumni associations of our Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) partner schools added to the chorus.

These words of encouragement and inspiration were broadcast on our Atria projection wall to our first JIP cohort as they entered the college on Day 1 @ Eunoia. There was also to be a surprise video for our Eunoians at the end of this momentous first day of school. The college would like to express its thanks to parents, alumni of Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School and Singapore Chinese Girls' School, and our colleagues from our JIP partner schools for their well wishes. We are glad to share a few of them here:

> Dear Eunoians, You've made it! Savour your college journey, relish every moment and be surprised at what each turn of the road may lead you to discover about yourself. Be bold, courageous and curious!

Mrs Melissa Neo, Singapore Chinese Girls' School

> Be a shining light and lead the way for the rest of your juniors! Enjoy yourselves, work hard, do your best, make new friends, live by the values learnt, and I'm sure you girls will do many people proud.

Mrs Hazel Lim

> Congratulations! You've made it through to yet another stage of your life! Give your all - immerse in the culture and learn, learn, learn! Make new friends, but look out for one another too. Take care!

Mr Tan Chee Wan

Mrs Irene Tan, Parent

> HI SC Kim Geks! Once an SC girl, always an SC girl 🙂 It is a brand new start and may you find great joy in going to school and meeting new friends. Step out of your comfort zone, step up to serve those around you and discover new things. You are the pioneer batch! Grab full use of this opportunity to leave a lasting legacy and the sky is your limit. Don't forget to take time to smell those flowers around you and listen to the lovely music by the birds. We hope to see you grow nearer the sky! Best wishes!

Mrs Kasey Gwee, Parent

Socialise, break out of your barriers and learn to communicate, see things from different perspectives and always carry a problem-solving mentality. Be true, be proud, be the best you can be. Good luck!
