The teachers at Eunoia Junior College were all late for class on Wednesday, 30 Aug 2017. Far from showing a lack of effort, they were simply obeying instructions — those of student-representatives who would escort them to classroom venues for a cosy breakfast prepared by their Civics Group students. True to the theme of the day 'Justeach League', one might call it a super start to the day and the September break.

Several were treated to unique classroom performances and games. All around, joy could be felt as students handed their teachers little notes and gifts of appreciation. As they made their way from the classroom to the hall for the main programme, a bigger surprise was in store.

DJs Gao Meigui and Henry Law from YES 933 were behind the scenes with student councillor Jeff Chin (17-U1). They were there on Jeff's invitation to express his gratitude towards Ms Rachel Teo, his Civics Tutor and subject tutor for History. Not without reason, she was visibly in tears.

The rest of the programme had much to live up to, and it did. Principal Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng and Senior Teacher (Physics) Mr Felix Lim led the teachers in reciting the Teachers' Pledge with pomp and pride. A skit by our Student Council brought to light the untold superpowers of our teachers, and performances by EJC Dance, Eusebius Chua Shuei Ray (17-I1), Soo Yen Chen (17-U5), Ng Weihan (17-O5) and a medley of dancers were reminders of why teachers teach: students who not only shine with guidance, but also remember those who stand by them.
