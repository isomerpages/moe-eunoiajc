On 6 Aug 2021, the college celebrated its 5th College Day and the official opening of its Bishan campus. Graced by Minister for Education Mr Chan Chun Sing, College Advisory Committee chairman Professor Su Guaning and members of Ministry of Education senior management, the event formally marked the college's move from its Mount Sinai campus to its permanent home at 2 Sin Ming Place.

Our 4th and 5th cohorts of Eunoians commemorated the opening of the campus in meaningful and personal ways. 'Journey' and 'Aspirations', two videos weaved by students from EJC Media and our alumni Advocado Films, provided both a nostalgic look at our early years and an introspective view of the Eunoia spirit. EJC Street Dance and Chamber Strings, student-initiated interest groups, gave verve to the proceedings. They were accompanied by the many creative, colourful visions of the college campus on the over 1200 postcards designed by our Eunoians and Eunoia staff.

The occasion also saw the launch of a college sculpture, commissioned by the alumni associations of our Joint Integrated Programme partner schools, Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School and Singapore Chinese Girls' School. The work, entitled _Dendrýllio,_ was designed by Eunoians, Ryan Siu Kar Yung and Jay Teo (both 20-O5) and Eunoia alumni Marilyn Koh Ning (19-E1) and Cheryl Celeste Tan (19-U2), under the supervision of consultant Teng Kai Wei. The sculpture draws inspiration from the college's growth to take the form of a tree:

> _Dendrýllio_, Greek for ‘Sapling’ symbolises the humble and yet flourishing growth of our Eunoia community and the undaunted soaring of our voices. With its extensive and overlapping roots, _Dendrýllio_ recalls how Eunoians, from diverse backgrounds, have united to form a cohesive common identity and foundation for Eunoia.

Our guests for the event, including Mr Chan Chun Sing, Director-General of Education Mr Wong Siew Hoong and Deputy Secretary (Services) Mr Lim Boon Wee, were then joined by our student ambassadors for a tour of the college campus. They then took part in Human Library sessions to engage with selected civics groups, exchanging their perspectives on the emerging issues and trends in the education landscape.

The 5th College Day was overall a thoughtful affair that celebrated the creative endeavour and reflective ethos of the Eunoia community, important saplings in the Eunoia identity that promise to grow from strength to strength.
