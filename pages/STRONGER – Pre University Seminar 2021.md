**Pre-U Sem 2021** is a four-day non-residential programme that brings together students from thirty pre-university institutions who are keen to make a difference to Singapore.

Participants will examine how Singapore can emerge stronger together as one through panel discussions, human library and brown bag sessions, blended learning and a special exhibition of their work.
