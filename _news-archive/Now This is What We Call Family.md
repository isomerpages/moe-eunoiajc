Our house became a home as we celebrated a Housewarming and Family Day on 14 October 2016, which we hope is a first of many. It was an opportunity to welcome members of staff who will join us in January 2017 and their family members into our very own Eunoia family. Finger food, popcorn, candy floss and an old-school ice cream cart - for the young in age and the young at heart - helped kickstart the event, and brought us a little closer together. The warm, homely conversations would not have been possible without the whole-hearted effort of our small yet strong Staff Engagement and Welfare Committee

Amidst the little carnival atmosphere, there was also time for history to be made. A Kids' Race for various age categories meant that the Eunoia track now comes with its own Eunoia Record, and patiently awaits our first cohort of Eunoians to set their own mark. Just as our family of students, staff and their families will soon expand when we formally start in 2017, the college looks forward to more gatherings and Family Days in the years, and decades to come.
