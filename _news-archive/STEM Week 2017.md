From 17 to 21 April, the college conducted an array of workshops and talks under the banner of STEM Week 2017, that would draw connections between real world design and classroom study, and challenge Eunoians to think beyond. The daily Mathematics puzzles certainly tapped on their curiosity and intellectual persistence, and proved to be the centre of attention for every Eunoian stepping into the campus.

Amongst the many other STEM activities on offer, the college was pleased to welcome Professor Sow Chorng Haur, Head of Department of Physics at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Prof Sow shared with our students the potential applications of nanoscience and engaged an enthusiastic group his passion for discovering scientific truths and the daily life of a researcher.

Our budding scientists also had the wonderful opportunity to hear from Professor Lim Seh Chun from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) on the transformation of engineering materials, Professor Teo Yik Ying, Vice Dean (Research) at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health on the function of Mathematics in medical care and policy-making, and learn more about cutting-edge defence science at the DSO National Laboratories.

On top of interacting with top minds in the respective fields, our Eunoians also delved into the world of STEM with their hands and hearts. Our own JC1 students from the Computing and Robotics Club held workshops on everything from constructing a Rube Goldberg machine for marvels to science of cryptography. The concepts of programming and engineering were also covered in a Sphero Workshop held by the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) pillar of SUTD, which like the rest of STEM Week, brought STEM concepts closer to the technologies of tomorrow.
