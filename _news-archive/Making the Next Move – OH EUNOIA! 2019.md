Have you made your next move?

One might say that an open house is always an assembly of moving parts, but **OH EUNOIA! Next Move** on 16 Jan 2019 saw a choreography of concurrent performances, exhibitions and taster lessons, all of which brought the Eunoian experience to our guests. The theme of this year’s Open House not only plays on the significance of our incoming cohort’s transition from secondary school to JC life, but also casts the spotlight on the upcoming milestone in the college’s development, as we look forward to making our own next move to the new Bishan campus at the end of the year.

If you were at our Open House, you would have been greeted warmly by our Student Ambassadors upon your arrival at the Atria. Perhaps you came to catch a glimpse of our school culture. Perhaps you wanted to find out more about our concept-based curriculum. As you followed our Ambassadors on a Campus Tour, you would have seen or even experienced both in action.

With their highly energetic Dance and Cheer performances at the Atria, Eunoians of the five Houses – Akila, Eder, Isami, Ora, Uzuri – gave **OH EUNOIA!** a rousing start. The distinctive identity of each house represents a different facet of the vibrant Eunoian identity. Following the House performances, our Performing Arts CCAs took over the stage with their repertoire of music, dance and drama. While you enjoyed the performances, your discerning eyes might have spotted members of the EJC Media Club behind the scenes, be it operating the sound system or capturing precious footage at various venues. In addition to celebrating achievements, our CCA showcase is really a display of Eunoians’ commitment to and ownership of their CCAs. As you explored the CCA booths, you tried your hand at Frisbee, you took a photograph with the quirky mascots of the Volleyball team, you learnt about the Eunoia spirit of 'Goodwill to All' from the Service Learning Club, you marvelled at the ingenuous creations of the Computing & Robotics Club… You emerged from the CCA booths wearing the various CCA stickers on your sleeve as a mark of the myriad experiences you had.

At the Library, our teachers were stationed at subject enquiry booths to share more about the demands of the A-Level Curriculum and inform your strategic moves and selecting your subject combination. The Eunoia learning experience was showcased through Taster Lessons helmed by various subject tutors. Perhaps, curious about General Paper, a subject new to you, you attended the Taster Lesson, during which you would have been actively involved in discussing and analysing the issue of inequality from multiple perspectives. Taking learning beyond the classroom, the Eunoia Global Orientation Programme takes you to several destinations worldwide, such as the UK, Sri Lanka and China, enhancing the development of cultural conversance in Eunoians.

If you were with us at **OH EUNOIA! Next Move**, we hope you have made the move to join us!
