Eunoia's first Humanities and Aesthetics Week sought to uncover and celebrate the Local Soul through a kaleidoscope of activities and performances from 15 to 19 May 2017.

Deputy Principal Mr Poh Chun Leck set the week off to a flying start. As he recounted the events of World War II and the importance of love in a time of constant conflict, students from the Humanities Programme threw a fleet of paper aeroplanes into the audience as a symbol of that love.

Like the audience, the week's performances received waves of affection as well. Students from the Music Elective Programme performed their own compositions, many of them on a secondary instrument. Led by Music teacher Mr Xie Zhizhong, they also opened ears to an experimental 'sound painting' session.

The Chinese Orchestra and Choir CCAs added texture to the music with special performances, while the student population were treated to eagerly anticipated Singapore Youth Festival item by EJC Dance.

Bringing even more colour to the college, the Art students also launched their own Visual Arts exhibition, showing off a range of disciplines including photography, 'type' photography and a dash of fashion design.

On the fourth Deep Dive Day of the year, Eunoians further immersed themselves in the Humanities and the Arts, learning more about street names in Singapore, the local Mandopop and short film scene, the implications of incentives and the sweet sensations of food poetry. The Connexions 2017 series would provide deeper inspiration, as the college proudly hosted Esplanade producer Sara Joan Fong, Vice Dean of Dance Programmes at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts Dr Caren Carino, and Cultural Medallion winner Haresh Sharma from The Necessary Stage.

To bring the week to a rapturous close, our Eunoians put their creative and aesthetic sensibilities on show with a series of two Eunoia Got Talent performances.
