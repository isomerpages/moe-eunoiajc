I graduated from Nanyang Technological University in 2002 with a Bachelor of Arts in Physical Education and English Language with a Diploma in Education. In 2009, I took a year off teaching to complete my Masters in Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy from Loughborough University, England.

From 2010 to 2015 I was the Head of Department for PE & CCA at my previous school where I oversaw many accomplishments in both Performing Arts and Sports & Games. I played a more hands-on role in leading the rugby team to numerous national titles over the years. I am a firm believer that in school, one is a student first and an athlete second. Discipline is key to attaining success, no matter what platform, and that is an attribute I try to instil in my charges be it in PE, CCA or my form class.

The philosophy I embrace is that every student can achieve and fulfil his or her potential if he or she is empowered to take charge of his or her learning. It needs to be within set boundaries where the student can be pushed to the limit with allowance for some failure. This allows the student to prepare himself or herself for life outside the secured walls of an educational institution.

 I am excited at the prospect of helping Eunoia Junior College, a young JC, to stamp its mark on the schools sports landscape in Singapore. It is an opportunity to build systems and processes based on appropriate value systems and principles; something that does not come along every often. I am fully invested in helping EJC to be the best it can be.
