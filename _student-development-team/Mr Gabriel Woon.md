I graduated with Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) in Life Sciences from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in June 2017, and completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education.

In my previous schools, I have taught across the Normal and Express streams, as well as pupils from the Integrated Programme, receiving valuable insights from both students and colleagues about my own teaching. I wish to continue this at Eunoia Junior College, working with the Biology unit to infuse a love for science and joy of learning in all our students.

A speech by Rita Pierson truly struck a chord with me, and this quote sums it up: ‘Every child deserves a champion; an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection and insists that they become the best they can possibly be.’ I look forward to helping my students achieve their fullest potential, regardless of their personal background or achievement level. In their two years at EJC, I hope that each and every one of them leaves a better person than they were before they joined, in both their academic studies and character.
