After graduating from Nanyang Technological University with a Bachelor of Science (Second Upper Honours) in Chemistry and Biological Chemistry, I worked at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) as a research officer before deciding to pursue my childhood ambition to become a teacher in 2010.

I started my teaching career in a junior college which had a caring and nurturing environment and emphasised the holistic development of students. I was privileged to work with passionate and dedicated colleagues to conceptualise student leadership and student development programmes. My proudest moments were witnessing my students overcoming personal barriers and in the process, uncovering their hidden strengths and growing in confidence and maturity.

Being immersed in a school with a strong staff development culture instilled in me the importance of mentorship and lifelong learning. I moved on to spend three years at the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) where I was given the opportunity to explore pedagogical innovations and broaden my perspectives on the educational landscape in Singapore. Through my interactions with educators from different fields and expertise, I saw a myriad of possibilities in the future of teaching and learning. The experience affirmed for me the important role our schools and classrooms play in preparing our students to be ‘future-ready’.

Knowledge acquisition alone is insufficient in a world of constant change. As an educator, I believe that my role goes beyond merely equipping our students with knowledge and preparing them for a high-stakes examination, but to nurture them as independent thinkers and develop their ownership and love for learning.

Eunoia’s vision for our students to be ‘Thinkers with Heart’ resonates strongly with me and my aspiration for our students is that they will grow to be able to think beyond themselves, to have empathy and care for the people and the world around them. I hope to anchor our students in values, so that they will have the courage to follow their internal GPS and persist in doing the right thing even if it means going against the grain.
