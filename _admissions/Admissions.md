Eunoia Junior College offers a 2 year programme leading up to the Singapore-Cambridge [GCE A-Level](/subject-combinations/) Examination. Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School students enrolled in the [Joint Integrated Programme](/admissions/jip/) join us in their fifth and sixth years in a seamless, holistic six-year integrated programme.

Students with Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination results may apply via the Ministry of Education [Joint Admissions Exercise](/admissions/jae/) (JAE). The college admits students via the annual [Direct School Admission](/admissions/dsa/) (DSA-JC) exercise in the May - July period.

##### **Becoming a Eunoian**

The Eunoian is excited about the opportunity to create something bigger than himself or herself, shape a school into one unlike any other, and give back to the community. 

True to our vision, Eunoians are youth with a sense of purpose, thinkers with a heart for others, and leaders who want to make a positive change in their community, and soon enough, [the world](/flagship-programmes/wrp/).

We believe that you will be a fuller person after your two years in the college. That is why we will offer you the most personal education yet. Our [Talent Development Programme](/flagship-programmes/tsp/) helps you understand your strengths and inspire you to soar to even higher levels of excellence. 

You will reflect on the roads you have conquered and plan the journey ahead with us. Your [life coach](/flagship-programmes/lcp/) will lead you to reflect on what drives you and what you can drive yourself towards.

Dive deep, stretch yourself, and [pursue your passion.](/flagship-programmes/pp/) Keep an open heart and mind. Give back to the people around you. If you are passionate enough, bold enough and far-sighted enough, we invite you to join us on the journey. Your legacy awaits.
