The Direct School Admission (DSA-JC) provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a Junior College (JC), based on a diverse range of academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the GCE ‘O’ Level examination. It is an annual exercise that takes place from May to August.

The 2025 Direct School Admission (DSA-JC) exercise opens on 7 May 2025. Interested students should go to our [News](https://www.eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/news/) Section to read the requirements before submitting the online application form which must reach us by 30 June 2025.

Details of the latest exercise has been published in our [News](https://www.eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/news/) section.

#### **Eligibility**

The DSA-JC exercise allows all Secondary 4 students with special talents and achievements to apply to Eunoia Junior College directly.

Successful applicants are guaranteed a place in the college provided they meet eligibility criteria for admission to a JC after the release of their Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level results.

Successful DSA-JC students will NOT be allowed to take part in the Joint Admissions Exercise as places have already been reserved for them in the DSA-JC schools.

They will also NOT be allowed to transfer to another JC after the release of the GCE 'O'-Level examination results. They are expected to honour their commitment to the posted DSA-JC schools and to participate in activities related to the talent selected in, for the duration of the programme admitted to.

Students who do not fulfill their DSA commitment without valid reason may be required to transfer out to another school.
