International students seeking admission are to apply directly to the college from October to December. Interested students should send in their cover letter and relevant education certificates to [eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg](mailto:eunoiajc@moe.edu.sg).

Students are strongly encouraged to submit [JPACT](http://pact.sg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=95) results for the college's consideration. If found suitable, the student will undergo an interview process and may be required to take school-based placement tests.

Admission is not guaranteed, and is subject to the international students meeting the college’s admission criteria and availability of vacancies.

More information can be found on the [MOE Admissions](https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students) website.
