Our First Class of Eunoians have shone brilliantly in the college's beginning years. For this third volume, we caught up with Jelita, Audrey, Jeff and Belle from the pioneer cohort of 29 Humanities Scholars to hear about their learning experience, the people who stood by them, and some wise words they wish to leave their juniors. Read more from our first class in Volumes **[1](/first-class-1/)**, [**2**](/first-class-2/), [**4**](/first-class-4/), [**5**](/first-class-5/) and [**6**](/first-class-6/).

**Jelita Jaimon (17-U1)** is a MOE Humanities Scholar who lights up any conversation and any setting. Ever vibrant yet calmly measured, her brimming love for the humanities saw her participate in the National Geography Talent Development Programme in 2017. In her role as a pioneering student councillor in the Culture unit, she was pivotal in conceptualising Euphoria, an islandwide race that culminated in a beach party at Sentosa for the JC1 cohort in 2017. Her remarkable optimism and grit were also seen in her involvement in the 'A' Division Netball Championship and various netball tournaments, as well as her leadership in the Netball CCA's blood donation drive. Amidst her heavy commitments, Jelita pursued her passion in music with her performances at numerous college events. Most notably, Jelita is one of two student performers who gave voice to our college anthem at its inauguration, the Official Opening ceremony and the college's first Graduation Ceremony. In addition, she wrote and performed a song as an expression of her gratitude on Teachers' Day. A talented youth, confident thinker and passionate leader, Jelita is a natural candidate for the EAGLES award and an embodiment of #EunoiaShining.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I surpassed my expectations and I am extremely proud of what I have achieved. The constant encouragement from my parents, teachers and peers really helped me through the most stressful of time. Know that I wasn’t alone in the journey also made me work hard alongside my peers.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

The 2 years were definitely 2 of the most fruitful and exciting years of my educational journey. The teaching team in EJC really pushed me to achieve the best of my abilities. My parents were my true pillars of support. Last but not least, my schoolmates and friends who braved these 2 years together while we grew and matured to be the best we could be together

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Do your best in whatever you do. Know that you are gifted and talented in your own light. Have faith. You are capable of wonderful things.

**Audrey Choong (17-O1)** was the valedictorian of her Arts cohort, a recipient of the SAF Young Leader Award and a Ministry of Education (MOE) Humanities Scholar. An exceptional student and critical thinker who offered H3 History and H2 Knowledge & Inquiry, she frequently went beyond the confines of the classroom, counting a job shadowing internship with MOE, her presentation at the inaugural Humanities Scholarship Programme symposium and her role as an emcee for the OnePeople.sg Model United Nations in 2017. With diligence and humility, Audrey placed on the Dean's List (Academic) in 2017 and 2018, receiving top honours for Knowledge & Inquiry, Literature in English and History.

Furthermore, her sharp intellect earned her the Outstanding Delegate Award at the 2017 Model Middle East Summit and led her team the second runner-up at the NUS Students' Political Association (NUSPA) Chancellor's Challenge Shield. As President of the Debate Society, she represented the college as its main speaker in a long list of ten competitions and led her executive committee to build a CCA that goes beyond results to give back to society. The epitome of an all-rounded student, Audrey volunteered at Meet-the-People sessions in the Toa Payoh East-Novena ward, and used her writing skills to give a voice to patients under the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Home Ventilation Programme.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I am thrilled! Paying attention in lectures and active engagement during tutorials helped. I am especially grateful to my tutors for their patience, compassion and eagerness to engage all students.

I think having a clear strategic approach of understanding the examination format and practising different skills/styles of writing allowed for development of the optimal study habits and exams hacks.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

Deeply refreshing, intensely fulfilling. I was privileged to enjoy good memories with my beloved 17-O1 classmates, who brought humour to every day in school. I also had an incredible time putting my soul into the invigorating sport of debate.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Take heart in the wild ride you have embarked on. Don't be disheartened by any setbacks you face. Open your heart to be touched by the incredible student, staff and neighbourhood community. Work hard for the A-Levels. It’ll be worth it in the end.

**Jeff Chin (17-U1)** is an outstanding all-rounder with strength of character, firm principles and an extraordinary positivity. Awarded the MOE Humanities Scholarship, he pursued his love for learning in multiple seminars, symposia and ministerial dialogues and undertook a H3 History independent research essay on the shifting historiographies of the Sino-Soviet split. As a pioneering Student Councillor and an Executive Committee member of the Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC), he made immense contributions in the Welfare and Communications units: initiating and managing a college-wide student forum, recruiting the first cohort of Student Ambassadors, overseeing the carnival segment for the college's Official Opening and organising training activities for his fellow members and juniors in ODAC. His love for the outdoors saw him participate and attain a bronze at the EW Barker Challenge in 2017. Effectively bilingual, he assisted at several Meet-the-People sessions at Toa Payoh East Community Centre, drafting letters of appeal and providing support for residents. Above all, Jeff's concern for his peers and community and his work ethic have left a deep, positive impression on his peers and teachers.

##### HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR RESULTS AND WHAT HELPED YOU ACHIEVE THEM?

I feel satisfied with my results. I think my results were made possible by the teachers as they have constantly guided me through the 2 years. Without them, I would not have persevered through my academic journey, considering the intensity of the A level curriculum.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

My two years in Eunoia were extremely enriching as I got to discover my passion. My friends in Eunoia made this journey meaningful as they taught me that there is more to life that academic grade. They have constantly encouraged me as I took on my many commitments.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Enjoy the two years and keep an open mind on the opportunities that come along the way

**Belle Tan (17-U1)** is a MOE Humanities Scholar who has been offered the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Defence Merit Scholarship. Alongside her aptitude for computational thinking, her passion for the humanities fuelled her participation in the 2017 Raffles Asia Programme Symposium, the 2017 Agricultural Forum and the 2018 NUS Geographical Society Essay Competition. As EJC Hockey's quarter mistress and Class Chairperson in 2018, Belle was a meticulous coordinator and exemplary leader who encouraged and edified her classmates with an open mind and perceptive mind. Without any prior experience in Hockey, she stepped into the role of goalkeeper for the team, which emerged runners-up in the 2018 'A' Division Championships. Amidst these commitments, Belle actively sought to serve the community, connecting her batchmates with Ghim Moh residents in the college's first Orientation, serving at Meet-the-People sessions at Ulu Pandan GRC and volunteering as a steward at the True Colours Festival. Truly, Belle is a resilient, decisive and driven leader of people.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY TO THE A-LEVELS HERE IN EUNOIA?

I feel very happy about my results because it was really unexpected. First, I am very grateful to my teachers for working so hard to help us and for never giving up on us. Their dedication to making sure we understand what we are supposed to is truly applaudable.

Aside from my teachers, my friends have been a great pillar of support and encouragement. My family has also been behind me, trying to help me and encouraging me during the challenging periods.

##### HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR JOURNEY IN EUNOIA AND WHAT MADE IT MEANINGFUL?

I would not have chosen any other school if I was given the chance again. These 2 years in EJ has allowed me to grow as a person, becoming more mature and aware of the issues in our society. I would like to thank all my teachers for bring great pillars of support in this journey, and I am really grateful to have been their student. I also have to specially thank Dr Chen for being my life coach and encouraging me to pursue my life goals. My friends that i have made also made this experience the best I’ve had in my education journey.

##### AS A EUNOIAN FROM OUR FIRST CLASS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR JUNIORS?

Never give up! Yes, it may be tough and challenging but it will pay off. Even if it doesn’t, at least you would have given your best. While you are busy doing homework and all your other commitments, learn to enjoy them, love what you are doing. Not only will you learn better, you will also have a great time doing so. Remember to take time off your studies to relax. Mental breaks are really important to ensure you are always in an optimal state of mind.
